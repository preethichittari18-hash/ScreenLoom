"Lemtrada is for any form of MS with relapses. Reversal of current damage is seen in anyone with natural neuronal reserve. Reversal becomes evident because the disease progression is finally halted and even small reversals become evident for the first time in a long time. It should definitely be on the table. IMO Just an FYI, Cladribine did not complete safety testing which is required by the FDA and EMA that gives long term data of significant SEs like thyroid disorders and cancers that may be produced by a DMT during extended tests. Short term tests were very positive but unfortunately not enough for drug approval. Cladribine patent protection was apparently only for a few more years so the costs to conduct the phase III testing could not be justified.

"I was diagnosed with stage 4 adeno lung cancer in 2009. I had 15 hits of radiation to the tumor in my right lung, then started on Carbo, Taxol and Avastin followed by six cycles of Gemzar for two nodules in my liver. I also had a spot on the apex region of my left lung. In 2010 I was given 150 mg Tarceva and it has worked up until November of last year. I was never tested for mutations in 2009, so my first request when they found a 1.2 cm tumor in my left lung was to do genomic sequencing. I had the biopsy done at Kaiser Hospital and then had my tissue sent to Foundation Medicine. I also had a blood draw and had a liquid biopsy done with Gardant Health. Foundation One report showed none of the standard mutations and only six alterations NTRK1, PIK3CA, ATM, MCL1, TAF1 and TP53. Gardant 360 showed only a EGFR amplification.  I have done some research on NTRK1 and PIK3CA alterations. When I spoke with MD Anderson they said the LOX-101 trial for NTRK1 was getting good results with fusion, but without fusion like me they only had one person in the trail. They mentioned that even if I enrolled in a clinical trial they would probably try me on immunotherapy first. I started on Opdivo at Kaiser and am receiving my second infusion today. I feel I will do well on Opdivo since I was a past smoker. Testing was done on my tissue for PD-L1 expression, but the results are still out. I know good results are coming in with and without expression. I have sought out second opinions and I am hearing  if Opdivo doesnât work my best option would be to focus on the PIK3CA alteration in some type of combo clinical trial. My questions are should I be looking at the PIK3CA alteration as my plan B? If so what would be by best course of treatment?

"Here's the latest update. My husband certainly feels like he is in remission with the Xeljanz. No UC symptoms -- for the first time in almost three years. No urgency, no cramping, no bleeding. Able to leave the house for work in the morning no worries. Previously, he had not been able to get below 22.5 mg prednisone without flaring. With the Xeljanz, had tapered down to 2.5 mg but was pretty sick -- not UC symptoms but clearly his adrenal glands haven't kicked in yet. Back up to 5 mg and meeting with doc this week to figure out how to get off the prednisone. No apparent side effects from Xeljanz, either. Hoping this one is the charm but if it is not, going to surgery with no regrets. Spouse diagnosed with UC in 2013. Developed antibodies to remicade, humira. Entyvio did not work after 6 infusions. Only thing that seemed to work was prednisone. Early March 2016 started Xeljanz off label. It is working.

"Hello, I approached the MS Barts health team for off-label cladribine in January this year. I had to go through the usual protocols, brain and spinal cord MRI and a lumbar puncture. In mid May I had a follow up appointment with the MS consultant. I was told that I am not eligible because there are no active lesions on my MRI scans and there was no evidence of inflamation in the lumbar puncture. There needs to be evidence that my MS is active before I am eligible for prescribing off-label cladribine. Yes I was gutted, in fact as he spoke to me I felt as if I had just been thrown onto a scrap heap. Then I thought about things on the journey home and actually I felt quite relieved. If the consultant could see no evidence that my MS is active then actually I am lucky. I might be disabled, I am medically retired, cannot walk unaided and am the proud owner of a Blue Badge but things could be a lot worse. Yup things could be a whole lot worse for me, none the less my MS is progressing. 6 years ago I could walk a few hundred metres without a stick, no chance of that today; I must always use a rollator and even then its not very far on a flat even surface.

"– Novartis today announced positive results of the Phase III EXPAND study showing that oral once-daily BAF312 (siponimod) significantly reduced the risk of confirmed disability progression compared with placebo in people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). SPMS is a form of MS characterized by continuous worsening of neurological function over time, independent of relapses. Topline results of EXPAND were presented at the 32 nd Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) in London, UK. BAF312 is an investigational selective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Initial, first interpretable data from the EXPAND study show:  · Treatment with BAF312 reduced the risk of three-month confirmed disability progression by 21% compared with placebo (p=0.013). The risk reduction for six-month confirmed disability progression was greater, further supporting robustness of the data. · A consistent reduction in the risk of three-month confirmed disability progression across predefined subgroups. · A significant difference in favor of BAF312 compared to placebo over 12 and 24 months in annualized relapse rate, the percent change in brain volume, and change from baseline in the volume of T2 lesions (brain lesions identified by a T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan). The difference in change from baseline in the timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW) was not significant. · BAF312 was generally safe and well tolerated, with a profile comparable to other drugs in the same class. “There are very few available treatment options to delay disease progression in SPMS, and there is a high unmet need for effective therapies with an acceptable safety profile for people with the condition,” said Vasant Narasimhan, Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer for Novartis. “Novartis is the global leader in understanding the role of S1P receptor modulation in the treatment of MS, and the positive results of the EXPAND study are a continuation of our ongoing efforts to innovate and meet the needs of patients . These data are a positive stride forward in an unserved disease area, and we look forward to evaluating next steps with health authorities.” EXPAND is the largest randomized, controlled study in SPMS to date. Patients enrolled in EXPAND were representative of a general SPMS population. They must have been diagnosed with SPMS and also demonstrated progression of disability in the two years prior to study. The majority of patients had non-relapsing SPMS. The mean age at study entry was 48 years, and patients had a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 6.0, which corresponds to the use of a walking aid. Novartis will complete full analyses of the EXPAND data and evaluate next steps in consultation with health authorities. The full study results, including data from primary and secondary endpoints, will be submitted for publication.  About the EXPAND Study The EXPAND study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study, comparing the efficacy and safety of BAF312 versus placebo in people with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). It is the largest randomized, controlled study in SPMS to date, and included 1,651 people with SPMS from 31 countries. At the time of the study, individuals enrolled in EXPAND had a mean age of 48 years and had been living with MS for approximately 17 years. Patients had received a diagnosis of SPMS, and also demonstrated progression of disability in the two years prior to study. They also had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 and 6.5 inclusive, with a median score of 6.0, which corresponds to the use of a walking aid. Patients were randomized to receive either 2mg BAF312 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study was the time to three-month confirmed disability progression, as measured by the EDSS, versus placebo. Secondary endpoints included delay in the time to six-month confirmed disability progression based on EDSS versus placebo, the time to confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in the timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW), T2 lesion volume, annualized relapse rate (ARR), and the safety and tolerability of BAF312 in people with SPMS.  About BAF312 (siponimod) BAF312 (siponimod) is an investigational selective modulator of specific types of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor. The S1P receptor is commonly found on the surface of specific cells residing in the central nervous system (CNS), that are responsible for causing CNS damage that drives loss of function in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). In-vitro studies show that BAF312 enters the brain and by binding to these specific receptors, may prevent the activation of these harmful cells, helping to reduce loss of physical and cognitive function associated with SPMS.  About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss. The evolution of MS results in an increasing loss of both physical (e.g., walking) and cognitive (e.g., memory) function. There are three types of MS: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). SPMS is characterized by gradual worsening of neurological function over time. This leads to a progressive accumulation of disability, independent of relapses, which can severely affect patients’ abilities to carry out everyday activities. It usually follows an initial phase of RRMS, which accounts for approximately 85% of all MS diagnoses; a quarter of people with RRMS will eventually go on to develop SPMS within 10 years of their initial RRMS diagnosis, rising to more than three-quarters after 30 years. There remains a high unmet need for effective and safe treatments to help delay disability progression in SPMS. MS affects around 400,000 people in the US.  About Novartis in Multiple Sclerosis The Novartis multiple sclerosis (MS) portfolio includes Gilenya (fingolimod, an S1P modulator), which is indicated for relapsing forms of MS and is also in development for pediatric MS. Extavia ® (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is approved in the US for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. In Europe, Extavia is approved to treat people with relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with active disease and people who have had a single clinical event suggestive of MS. In addition to BAF312 (siponimod) in development in SPMS, investigational compounds include ofatumumab (OMB157), a fully human monoclonal antibody in development for relapsing MS. Ofatumumab targets CD20, and is currently being investigated in two Phase III pivotal studies.

"""For the record"": It was not only MD Stephen Hauser who tried to cool down the hype around this immunosupressive agent ocrelizumab. Several other MD´s have been catious about this ms agent. In my Point of view, there have been to many get carried away views on this agent. It will only up in disapointments for those patients who are willing to take the risk with this Ocrelizumab (CD 20) agent. And as for criticizing prof G earlier statement about the fatc, that many RRMS patients who were on Rituximab progressed to SPMS, all according to MD Stephen Hauser, I think, no offence ment, you really splitting hairs. The essence of the content remains: obviously, at least the well respected MD Stephen Hauser have some doubts about Rituximab abilities to prevent RRMS patients to progress into SPMS. And since Ocrelizumab and Rituximab have the same Mode of action (CD20), it raises really some serious questions about Ocrelizumabs abilities to prevent CDP/EDSS in this RRMS patients The only ""error"" or ""mistake"" prof G made, was that you, and maybe others, were given the impression that MD Hauser made this statement publicly on stage. But it was mentioned to Prof G directly off stage in dialogue with MD Stephen Hauser: So the fact that many of MD Stephen Hauser patients treated with rituximab have developed SPMS remains. So essentially prof G was correct in his original statement with regard to that fact.

The most common adverse reaction with HUMIRA was injection site reactions. In placebocontrolled trials, 20% of patients treated with HUMIRA developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in patients with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RAII, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for patients taking HUMIRA and 4% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of HUMIRA in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%).  Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global HUMIRA clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 HUMIRA-treated patients versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated patients. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and postsurgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ].  Tuberculosis And Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 HUMIRA-treated patients, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian HUMIRA-treated patients, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ].  Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of patients treated with HUMIRA and 7% of placebo-treated patients that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two patients out of 3046 treated with HUMIRA developed clinical signs suggestive of newonset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with HUMIRA on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in patients receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (40 mg SC every other week) in patients with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.5% of controltreated patients. Since many of these patients in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between HUMIRA and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of HUMIRA in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of HUMIRA and MTX than those treated with HUMIRA alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of HUMIRA treatment. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of HUMIRA in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with CD with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 0.9% of control-treated patients. In the Phase 3 trial of HUMIRA in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these patients discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in patients with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.0% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in patients with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients. In controlled trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of HUMIRA-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in HUMIRA-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients.  Immunogenicity Patients in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab during the 6- to 12-month period. Approximately 5% (58 of 1062) of adult RA patients receiving HUMIRA developed low-titer antibodies to adalimumab at least once during treatment, which were neutralizing in vitro. Patients treated with concomitant methotrexate (MTX) had a lower rate of antibody development than patients on HUMIRA monotherapy (1% versus 12%). No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients. The long-term immunogenicity of HUMIRA is unknown. In patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years of age, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 16% of HUMIRA-treated patients. In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence was 6% compared to 26% with HUMIRA monotherapy. In patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7% (1 of 15) of HUMIRA-treated patients, and the one patient was receiving concomitant MTX. In patients with AS, the rate of development of antibodies to adalimumab in HUMIRA-treated patients was comparable to patients with RA. In patients with PsA, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA monotherapy was comparable to patients with RA; however, in patients receiving concomitant MTX the rate was 7% compared to 1% in RA. In adult patients with CD, the rate of antibody development was 3%. In pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA was 3%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 32% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 10%. In patients with moderately to severely active UC, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA was 5%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 25% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 20.7%. In patients with Ps, the rate of antibody development with HUMIRA monotherapy was 8%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 40% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 20.7%. In Ps patients who were on HUMIRA monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal. Anti-adalimumab antibodies were measured in clinical trials of subjects with moderate to severe HS with two assays (an original assay capable of detecting antibodies when serum adalimumab concentrations declined to < 2 mcg/mL and a new assay that is capable of detecting antiadalimumab antibody titers in all subjects, independent of adalimumab concentration). Using the original assay, the rate of anti-adalimumab antibody development in subjects treated with HUMIRA was 6.5%. Among subjects who stopped HUMIRA treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied), the immunogenicity rate was 28%. Using the new titer-based assay, antiadalimumab antibody titers were measurable in 61% of HS subjects treated with HUMIRA. Antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed. In adult patients with non-infectious uveitis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 4.8% (12/249) of patients treated with adalimumab. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/Ml (approximately 23% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 21.1%. Using an assay which could measure an anti-adalimumab antibody titer in all patients, titers were measured in 39.8% (99/249) of non-infectious uveitis adult patients treated with adalimumab. No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to adalimumab or titers, and are highly dependent on the assay. The observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to adalimumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.  Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to HUMIRA in 2468 patients, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). HUMIRA was studied primarily in placebo- controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients received 40 mg HUMIRA every other week. Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in patients treated with HUMIRA 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion.

Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, HUMIRA was studied in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of patients within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with HUMIRA and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of patients experienced an infection while receiving HUMIRA with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in HUMIRA-treated patients were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA patients who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this patient population treated with HUMIRA were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in patients receiving HUMIRA was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of HUMIRA treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of patients and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of patients treated with HUMIRA who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No patient developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of patients treated with HUMIRA developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several patients. CPK levels decreased or returned to normal in all patients. Most patients were able to continue HUMIRA without interruption. In Study JIA-II, HUMIRA was studied in 32 patients who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this patient population was similar to the safety profile seen in patients 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of patients experienced an infection while receiving HUMIRA. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of patients receiving HUMIRA in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of patients and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity.  Psoriatic Arthritis And Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 395 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebocontrolled trials and in an open label study and in 393 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies. The safety profile for patients with PsA and AS treated with HUMIRA 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA, HUMIRA Studies RA-I through IV.  Adult Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 1478 adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in four placebocontrolled and two open-label extension studies. The safety profile for adult patients with CD treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA.  Pediatric Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 192 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease in one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study. The safety profile for pediatric patients with Crohn's disease treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in adult patients with Crohn's disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with HUMIRA were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving HUMIRA in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving HUMIRA in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions.  Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 1010 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in two placebocontrolled studies and one open-label extension study. The safety profile for patients with UC treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA.  Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies. The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, HUMIRA-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%).  Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebocontrolled studies and one open-label extension study. The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with HUMIRA weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of HUMIRA. Flare of HS, defined as ≥25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from HUMIRA treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies.  Uveitis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 464 adult patients with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric patients with uveitis (Study PUV-I). The safety profile for patients with UV treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA.  Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HUMIRA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to HUMIRA exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis",humira,Cancer Treatment and Management,NEUTRAL,0.7,"Common side effects include injection site reactions (redness, itching, pain, bruising, swelling, or bleeding), headache, stuffy nose, sinus pain, or stomach pain.,Serious side effects of Humira include: fast/irregular/pounding heartbeat, stomach pain, blood in the stools, mental/mood changes, severe headache, easy bruising or bleeding, dark urine, yellowing eyes and skin, leg pain or swelling, numbness or tingling of the arms/hands/legs/feet, unsteadiness, unexplained muscle weakness, difficulty with speaking/chewing/swallowing/facial movements, vision changes, extreme fatigue, joint pain, or butterfly-shaped rash on the nose and cheeks."

My walking was so poor, I couldn’t imagine how I would manage if it got worse, even for a few weeks. I was also scared that my bladder control would get worse again and this would be a huge problem because it takes me so long to walk to the loo.

"Hello Everyone! Just posting to let you all know I will be receiving my first Ocrevus infusion this Thursday. I'm a little nervous since I'm not entirely sure what I am in for, but hopefully everything will be okay.

"Hi sezz, It’s terrific that your partner has had such a good response to Opdivo, but it’s not at all unusual in such cases to skip treatments or increase the interval between treatments in order to minimize side effects. The half-life of a drug is simply the amount of time it takes until only half of the drug remains in the body. I wouldn’t put too much faith in the description of half-life as the time that the drug is effective. When new drugs are tested in trials, the eventual recommended dosage is set at the maximum tolerated dose, rather than the minimum effective dose. That’s because the effective dose for each particular patient may differ, so the thought is that if you give everyone the maximum dose most patients can tolerate, you maximize the chance of a good response for all patients. The disadvantage of this approach is that some patients will get a dose higher than what they need, and suffer more side effects than necessary. With regard to half-life, if half of the standard dose remains in the body after 25 days, that amount may continue to be effective for some (if not many) patients. As an example, the half-life of the standard 150 mg daily dose of Tarceva is 36.2 hours. At that point, 75 mg remains in the body, from the previous day’s dose but another 150 mg dose has been added. Yet some patients who have difficulty tolerating that dose do quite well on as little as 25 mg/day. With that dose, at any given time there is much less than 75 mg of the drug in their body, yet it’s still effective. Your partner may want to discuss the possibility of either a dose reduction or an increase in the interval between treatments to, for example, 21 days. That might be an effective dose with fewer side effects. JimC Forum moderator",tarceva,Cancer Treatment and Management,POSITIVE,0.6,Side effects

"AbbVie’s JAK1 inhibitor upadacitinib has proved more effective than the company’s widely-used TNF blocker Humira in a phase III trial in rheumatoid arthritis patients, without adding to a tally of thrombotic side effects. Upadacitinib met all the primary and secondary endpoints in the SELECT-COMPARE study - outperforming both placebo and Humira (adalimumab) on a range of clinical measures including the proportion of patients going into clinical remission, with 29% of those on AbbVie’s drug achieving that level of response compared to 18% with Humira and 6% of the placebo group. A 20% or more improvement in symptoms (ACR20) was seen in 71% of the upadacitinib group, versus 63% for Humira and 36% for placebo, which just achieved statistical significance, but AbbVie’s drug fared much better compared to its active comparator on the tougher ACR50 and ACR70 measures. The results were achieved in patients with moderate-to-severe RA who were being treated with methotrexate but whose symptoms were not being controlled. Crucially for AbbvVie, there were no cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the 1,629-patent study, something that was observed in two earlier phase III studies of the drug (SELECT-MONOTHERAPY and SELECT-BEYOND) and had claimed patient lives. Analysts said the lack of VTEs in the latest study reduced the risk in the upadacitinib programme and raises the drug’s chances of regulatory approval. The drug is vying to become the third drug in the class after Pfizer’s Xeljanz (tofacitinib) and Eli Lilly’s Olumiant (baricitinib), which was turned down by the FDA at first filing because thrombosis cases raised safety concerns. Lilly’s drug was approved in Europe, however, and has been refiled in the US with a verdict due later this year. Upadacitinib (also known as ABT-494) has been tipped by some analysts as a future leader of the category with sales of up to $3.5bn, with some suggesting it could even climb as high as $5bn at peak if it also shows its worth in follow-up indications like psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis. It’s one of three new drugs AbbVie had earmarked to help offset the decline in Humira sales that will follow the loss of patent protection, which will occur later this year in Europe but not until 2023 in the US. Humira is also being challenged by a number of newer drugs but thanks to price increases is still on a growth path. One of those new hopefuls - Rova-T for lung cancer - failed in trials but upadacitinib and anti-IL-23 antibody risankizumab (ABBV-066) remain on track after the latter reported positive phase III results in psoriasis in February.",upadacitinib,Cancer Treatment and Management,POSITIVE,0.9,"It has proved more effective than Humira in a phase III trial in rheumatoid arthritis patients.,It met all the primary and secondary endpoints in the SELECT-COMPARE study.,Outperformed both placebo and Humira (adalimumab) on a range of clinical measures including the proportion of patients going into clinical remission.,A 20% or more improvement in symptoms (ACR20) was seen in 71% of the upadacitinib group, versus 63% for Humira and 36% for placebo.,The results were achieved in patients with moderate-to-severe RA who were being treated with methotrexate but whose symptoms were not being controlled.,There were no cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the 1,629-patent study.,Analysts said the lack of VTEs in the latest study reduced the risk in the upadacitinib programme and raises the drug’s chances of regulatory approval.,It’s one of three new drugs AbbVie had earmarked to help offset the decline in Humira sales that will follow the loss of patent protection, which will occur later this year in Europe but not until 2023 in the US."

"Hello all, I am new here and came across this place looking for advice on my new treatment. I was diagnosed in 2010 with RRMS. I have been doing ok on Rebif all this time but recently had a MRI and have an active lesion. I have also suffered from dizzy spells, weakness in left hand and worst of all terrible fatigue, memory loss and difficulty with concentration. Its got to the point where people at work who dont know I have MS are saying I look like someone has taken out my battery. I try hard not to let people notice but its getting harder. I have also had a few other random symptoms but find it hard to say if its normal or the MS causing it. Anyway I went to the hospital today to have my meds looked at due to the MRI results. The advice from the neurolagist was to go on Mavenclad or Gilenya. I have read everything I could find on both and also looked both up on here but I am not sure which to choose. I like the idea that Maveclad is a 2 year treatment over a total of 5 days each year. I know I will still need to be monitored but it just seems ideal. Something they said bothers me which is why I am not sure. They said Gilenya is tablets daily but it means if I stop the effect just wears off but Mavenclad is not reversable. Not sure this is a problem but just seems so final. Also they say no treatment is needed in year 3 & 4. What happens after that in year 5….. Nothing is mentioned anywhere if you just do the course again or are they expecting the MS to stay in remission? I think these are things I need to email my MS nurse about. She did say what they would yreat me wirh if the Mevenclad would not work where as with Gilenya there are a couple of alternatives. The side effects of th Gilenya seem a but worse too which is why I am drawn to the Mavenclad. Just really hard making this decision. I know none of you can tell me what to choose but it helps knowing there might be others in my shoes and at least you all understand what Im dealing with. Thanks for reading my post would appriciat any advice if any of you have been in a similar situation. Also if anyone has had the Mavenclad treatment.

"ALT-803 is composed of an IL-15 receptor fusion protein and a mutant form of IL-15. 1,2 It targets the shared IL-2 and IL-15 pathway, activating immune cells and nivolumab prevents tumor cells from evading them. “The combination of these two different effects might work synergistically to eliminate cancer cells,” noted Dr Rolfo and Dr Smits. 1 Significant and invariable toxicity hampered the use of IL-2 cytokine immunotherapy at therapeutic doses. 1,2 But authors of the new study reported that subcutaneously-injected 20 μg ALT-803 per kg once weekly (on weeks 1-5 of four 6-week cycles for 6 months) is safe and did not drive up nivolumab-associated adverse event rates. 2 The authors reported no dose-limiting toxicities for ALT-803 plus nivolumab and did not identify a maximum tolerated dose. 2 In a post-hoc analysis, 29% of study participants experienced a partial response, suggesting that “we can reassert control” in relapsed and ICI-refractory lung cancer, noted lead study author John M. Wrangle, MD, of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, and his coauthors. 2 “What's unique about our trial is that it's two completely different types of drugs that have never been combined in humans before, and the trial demonstrated that these drugs can be safely administered,” said senior study author Mark P. Rubinstein, PhD, of the Medical University of South Carolina, in a press release. 5  Related Articles Timely Reporting of Palliative Care Needs Leads to More Appropriate End-of-Life Care in NSCLC Osimertinib Improves Quality-of-Life and Global Health Status in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The post-hoc analysis suggests that ALT-803 might salvage ICI in refractory NSCLC, Dr Rubinstein suggested. No dual-immunotherapies or non-PD1/PD-L1 ICIs are yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for NSCLC. 2 More effective immunotherapy regimens that can bring clinical benefits to more patients with lung cancer and to “resurrect clinical benefit” after resistance emerges, represents a “huge unmet need,” they noted. 2 “The ability of ALT-803 to re-induce immunotherapeutic response in PD-1-relapsed and refractory NSCLC should stimulate a surge of renewed interest in cytokine combination treatments for cancer.” Injection-site reactions and flu-like symptoms were common (affecting 90% and 71% of patients, respectively). 2 Two patients experienced grade-3 toxicity (lymphocytopenia and fatigue) and another patient experienced a grade 3 heart attack. No grade 4 toxicities or patient deaths were reported. The study was funded by Altor BioScience, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center. Phase 2 trial enrollment is “ongoing,” the study authors reported. 2 There is reason for caution. As Dr Rolfo and Dr Smits point out, osimertinib and durvalumab showed similar early promise, only to later demonstrate troubling rates of adverse events. But even they express optimism. The study has “laid the foundation for further clinical investigation of the use of IL-15 agonists combined with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors as immunotherapy-based treatments to improve outcomes of patients with NSCLC and other tumors,” they wrote. 2 “Combination treatments are the future of immunotherapy.” References",osimertinib,Lung Cancer Diagnosis and Management,POSITIVE,0.8,"ALT-803 might salvage ICI in refractory NSCLC,Injection-site reactions and flu-like symptoms were common (affecting 90% and 71% of patients, respectively),Two patients experienced grade-3 toxicity (lymphocytopenia and fatigue) and another patient experienced a grade 3 heart attack"

"The development of ALK inhibitors for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rapidly progressing, yet acquired treatment resistance remains a key issue for a majority of patients. 1 ALK as a Target in NSCLC ALK gene fusions in NSCLC were first reported in 2007, and it was since determined that 3% to 7% of NSCLC tumors harbor an ALK rearrangement. These aberrations occur more frequently among younger patients with adenocarcinoma histology who never smoked or were low-level smokers. The EML4-ALK fusion is the most common, though all fusions contain the preserved ALK tyrosine kinase domain, an N-terminal promoter from the partner gene, and an N-terminal oligomerization domain of the partner, resulting in constitutive activation. ALK fusion proteins promote signaling pathways important for cell growth and survival. Four years since the discovery of ALK fusions in NSCLC, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. Second- and third-generation ALK inhibitors were since developed. First-generation ALK Inhibitors Crizotinib is a first-generation ALK inhibitor, which also targets MET and ROS1, that can result in impressive response rates compared with chemotherapy. In 2 phase 3 trials, crizotinib yielded an overall response rate (ORR) of 65% and 74% compared with 20% with pemetrexed or docetaxel ( P < .001), or 45% with pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin ( P < .001), respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was also significantly improved in both trials, at 7.7 months and 10.9 months with crizotinib compared with 3.0 months with pemetrexed or docetaxel ( P < .001) or 7.0 months with pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin ( P < .001). Overall survival (OS), however, was not significantly different with crizotinib compared with chemotherapy in either trial. This could be because of crossover after progression during chemotherapy, or due to acquired resistance. Crizotinib also lacks efficacy against central nervous system (CNS) metastases, and 20% of patients will develop CNS metastases during crizotinib treatment. Another issue is serious adverse events (AEs) not reported in initial trials, including erythema multiforme, acute interstitial lung disease, renal polycytosis, contact esophagitis, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and hypersensitivity. 2 A major challenge with crizotinib, as with all targeted therapies, is treatment resistance. Secondary resistance to crizotinib typically occurs within 1 year due to several known mechanisms. ALK gene amplifications or mutations within the kinase domain can occur, resulting in continued activity despite ALK inhibition. Activation of other components of the signaling pathways, such as EGFR, HSP90, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, can also overcome ALK inhibition by providing the tumor alternate oncogenic drivers. 2",pemetrexed,Lung Cancer Diagnosis and Management,NEUTRAL,0.5,"acquired treatment resistance,efficacy against central nervous system (CNS) metastases,serious adverse events (AEs),secondary resistance to crizotinib,ALK gene amplifications or mutations within the kinase domain,activation of other components of the signaling pathways, such as EGFR, HSP90, PI3K/AKT/mTOR,tumors alternate oncogenic drivers"

"@avengr13 I think I addressed an earlier post of yours….. maybe not. We have so much in common except I have spent the last 3 years reading everything available, applied for a clinical trial, fostered relationships with others in the clinical trial here in the States(FL). I just missed out on the last trial and have been fighting MS for decades even though just DX’d ’05 RRMS which is key to qualifying for Lem in the States. Depending on the insurance carrier, you either must be RRMS or a relapsing form of MS. Payers are becoming very biased against us “older” patients. They want us all to be deemed progressive so that they can decline their coverage of a DMD. I don’t think Tysabri should be in the same discussion as Lem. I have taken both drugs. Lem only required 8 infusions in the first 12 months for most participants in the 5 year clinical trial. It “resets” the immune system the first 30 days so MS traits are “unlearned”. Tysabri suppresses the immune system, no reset, and carries the risk of PML. Lem HALTED or REVERSED the progression of MS for most participants in the trial with NO risk of PML. Tysabri requires continuous monthly infusions forever.that can slow the progression of MS.

 thanks for sharing your info.  love to hear from you on what you think.   
 
 dianaHi Diana,
 I see you started this thread last year. I also see that the cancer has spread. You could say that that is a most unfortunate development.
 I cannot help you except to tell you that a close friend of mine spent the last week attending to his mother who has been diagnosed with a recurrence of lung cancer after a 10 year remission, if that is even the right term.
 This is an interesting case because my friend is both a pastor of 40 years and a Hospice Chaplin for the last 10. His mother has rebuffed all talk about GOD and the afterlife for all the years he has been in the ministry. Her mantra has been “Denial has worked well for me this far, so why change.”
 You can imagine the consternation this has caused Gary, my friend. Now she is scared, and feels that it is too late.
 The point is, she may beat this again, just as you may, since you are fighting the same beast.
 We are told very clearly not to fear. Fat chance of that, most would say. But it is true and it is true because of this statement which is just as true.
 “To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord….. which is far better.”
 Gary recently shared with a group of us the “7 things we should all like to know before we die”. He complied this commentary from his 10 years as a Hospice Chaplin. It includes an outline as well as 2 ½ hours of personal stories and heartfelt explanations on each point.
 If you feel you might enjoy this, please feel free to private message your address information and I will forward a copy of both tomorrow when I get to the office.
 I pray GOD’s continued blessings on you even when it feels hard to feel blessed.

"The reason I put up this small table is because these antibody types turned out to be very important. For those who wants to know more here is the explanation. When an antibody binds to a cell it marks it for destruction by macrophages. That's how my lymphoma drug rituximab works. It binds to its target on my B cells and that kills all B cells. Some of the cancerous, some are not. Then the bone marrow makes new B cells. I was always wondering why macrophages don't kill T cells marked by checkpoint PD-1 antibodies. Turns out the type IgG4 (Opdivo, Keytruda) is not attractive to macrophages (very slight attraction). The strongest attraction of macrophages is to AgG1 type of antibodies. So, if a checkpoint inhibitor is type IgG1 there will be serious side effects as macrophages will recognize this type as a mark to kill the cell. As some of these checkpoints can be expressed on normal cells there are side effects. If you look at the pd-l1 antibodies only Avelumab belongs to type IgG1. That puts a target on all cells that express pd-l1 including normal cells. Macrophages would destroy all marked cells. The other three antibodies are better designed. Tecentriq and Durvalumab have a modified (engineered) IgG1 type that does not attract macrophages and BMS-936559 has the type IgG4 as in the case of Opdivo and Keytruda (not attractive to macrophages). The purpose of the checkpoint antibodies is not to kill any cell, but to prevent the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1. That will activate another mechanism in which activated T cells kill abnormal cancer cells.",opdivo,Antibody Treatments and Their Side Effects,POSITIVE,0.7,"Antibody type IgG4 (like Opdivo) is not attractive to macrophages,Some checkpoint inhibitors are type IgG1 which can attract macrophages and cause side effects"
"In 1996, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ® (NCCN ® ) published its first set of Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines ® ) covering 8 tumor types. Guidelines are now published for more than 60 tumor types and topics. Some of the key updates were presented at NCCN’s 23rd Annual Conference and are briefly summarized here. Rectal Cancer “There is a great deal interest now in giving all total neoadjuvant therapy, ie, chemotherapy, then chemoradiation, then surgery or chemoradiation, then chemotherapy, then surgery. Either is now recommended in the guidelines.” —Christopher Willett, MD   Christopher Willett, MD A number of important changes were made to the NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer, as presented by Christopher Willett, MD , of Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina: There is greater acceptance of an observational approach, ie, “watch and wait, nonoperative management,” for select patients achieving a complete clinical response and no evidence of residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. The guidelines are now more closely aligned with the Guidelines for Colon Cancer. A new definition of the rectum is based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging, delineating the area below a virtual line from the sacral promontory to the upper end of the symphysis. The use of MRI in staging has been elevated in importance. There is a new emphasis on neoadjuvant therapy, building on the concurrent use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy with additional chemotherapy. Colon Cancer “With data from the IDEA trial, we now have a platform for a framework to discuss these data with patients, and that’s the strength of IDEA.” —Axel Grothey, MD   Axel Grothey, MD Axel Grothey, MD , of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Phoenix, and Alan Venook, MD , of the University of California, San Francisco, described revisions to the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer: Data from the pivotal IDEA trial, which evaluated 3 vs 6 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, have been incorporated into the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer. The guidelines recommend that for low-risk stage III patients, the preferred regimen is CAPEOX (capecitabine/oxaliplatin) for 3 months or FOLFOX (leucovorin/fluorouracil/oxaliplatin) for 3 to 6 months (category 1 for 6 months). For high-risk stage III patients (T4/N1–2, or any T and N2), the preferred regimen is CAPEOX for 3 to 6 months (category 1 for 6 months) or FOLFOX for 6 months (category 1). In metastatic disease, tumor sidedness should be a consideration in choosing a biologic. For  BRAF -mutated advanced disease, options include several triplets. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are approved as a subsequent line of therapy in patients with advanced disease whose tumors are found to be microsatellite instability–high (MSI-high) or are mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors if determined by gene sequencing. Breast Cancer “If you reflect what’s gone on over the past couple of years, it’s really been the era of the CDK4/6 inhibitors…. Reflected in the guidelines are a number of different options among the three CDK4/6 inhibitors, with a category 1 level of evidence.” —William J. Gradishar, MD   William J. Gradishar, MD Several speakers updated attendees on breast cancer management, including William J. Gradishar, MD , of Northwestern University, Chicago; Sharon H. Giordano, MD, MPH , of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston; and Anthony D. Elias, MD , of the University of Colorado Cancer Center, Denver. These updates for patients with HER2-positive or hormone receptor–positive disease were presented: For HER2-positive patients, there are two new adjuvant treatment options: pertuzumab (Perjeta; given with trastuzumab [Herceptin] and chemotherapy) and neratinib (Nerlynx; for use as extended hormonal treatment following trastuzumab in high-risk patients). For those with advanced hormone receptor–positive disease, treatment options now include three inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), both for postmenopausal and premenopausal patients. The guidelines reiterated that women who are postmenopausal at diagnosis may consider extending endocrine therapy for an additional 5 years, although the benefits and risks must be weighed. Breast cancer staging was updated to reflect changes in the  American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual (8th Edition, 2017). Treatment recommendations were ranked according to “preferred,” “other,” and “useful in certain circumstances.” Screening and Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma “When we screen for hepatocellular carcinoma, we are finding disease at a stage that is amenable to potentially curative treatment and, associated with that, improvements in survival at 1, 3, and 5 years.” —Anne M. Covey, MD   Anne M. Covey, MD Anne M. Covey, MD , of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, described the updates to the guidelines for screening and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: Patients deemed at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (ie, those with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B infection) should undergo ultrasound with or without assessment of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a primary screening tool (with certain exceptions). Patients with a negative ultrasound should continue surveillance with ultrasound with or without AFP every 6 months. Follow up with ultrasound with or without AFP in 3 to 6 months is recommended if a lesion < 10 mm is identified. For those with a positive AFP level or a nodule ≥ 10 mm, capsular retraction or vascular invasion on ultrasound, further workup with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required. Lung Cancer “There is a growing list of approved targets and therapies included in the 2018 NCCN Guidelines [for Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer] as well as emerging targets. Why does this matter? Because targeted therapies improve survival.” —Karen L. Reckamp, MD, MS   Karen L. Reckamp, MD, MS The 2018 NCCN Guidelines Updates for Targeted Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) recommend molecular testing for first initial diagnosis, since targeted therapies that can improve outcomes for many patients are available, explained Karen L. Reckamp, MD, MS , of City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California. Approved therapies are available for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and BRAF mutations. The list of emerging “actionable” targets is growing. The 2018 NCCN Guidelines incorporate new therapies, including the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib (Tagrisso) and the ALK inhibitor alectinib (Alecensa), as first-line preferences. Kidney Cancer “It is a very exciting time in renal cell carcinoma, with new treatments. Most new treatments are for clear cell carcinoma.” —Eric Jonasch, MD   Eric Jonasch, MD There were several updates to the 2018 NCCN Guidelines for Kidney Cancer, noted Eric Jonasch, MD , of the Von Hippel-Landau Clinical Center at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Adjuvant sunitinib (Sutent) is the first adjuvant therapy to be endorsed by the 2018 NCCN Guidelines for patients with stage II and III high-risk renal cell carcinoma and clear cell histology (category 2 B). Two new options are included for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma: The combination of ipilimumab plus nivolumab for poor- and intermediate-risk patients. Cabozantinib (Cabometyx) was added as a first-line option for poor- and intermediate-risk patients with relapsed renal cell carcinoma or stage IV unresectable advanced renal cell carcinoma. Prostate Cancer “If you do it properly [ie, intermittent androgen-deprivation therapy, (ADT)], there is a significant quality-of-life benefit. We can be more intelligent and personalize ADT.” —James L. Mohler, MD, and Peter R. Carroll, MD   Peter R. Carroll, MD  James L. Mohler, MD The 2018 NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines recommend baseline screening beginning at age 45, which is younger than in the other sets of guidelines, explained Peter R. Carroll, MD , of the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. Risk stratification and proper staging workup are emphasized more strongly in the 2018 iteration of the NCCN Guidelines than in the past, explained James L. Mohler, MD , of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York. The 2018 NCCN guidelines provide alternatives to routine biopsy in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, including the use of serum and urine biomarkers and multiparametric MRI before moving to biopsy. Active surveillance is advised for very low–risk and low-risk patients. Molecular testing and germline testing are recommended early in the course of disease for patients with a strong family history (defined for the first time in the new guidelines), with the aim of developing more personalized medicine. Germline testing is advised for more advanced disease. Testing for germline and/or somatic mutations should be considered in all men with high-risk, very high–risk, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer. Men with BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM , PALB2 , and FANCA should be referred for genetic counseling and early use of platinum chemotherapy or enrollment in a clinical trial. Men with MSI and deficient MMR should be referred for genetic counseling and are eligible for pembrolizumab when they fail to respond to ADT. According to the 2018 NCCN Guidelines, patients with asymptomatic castration-naive metastatic prostate cancer should receive intermittent ADT; they should be made aware of a possible small trade-off in overall survival for improved quality of life during the off cycle. For symptomatic men, continuous ADT should be considered, but if the PSA level decreases to < 4 ng/mL and certainly < 0.2 ng/mL, intermittent ADT is reasonable. Younger healthier men should consider docetaxel or abiraterone (Zytiga) added to ADT, whereas older and/or unhealthier men should receive ADT. Apalutamide (Erleada) is now one of the recommended second-generation antiandrogens incorporated in the 2018 NCCN Guidelines. The updated guidelines distinguish between management of patients with visceral metastasis versus skeletal metastasis. Gliomas: Molecular Pathology in Staging and Treatment of Anaplastic Gliomas “These three markers [co-deletion of 1p and 19q, IDH 1 and IDH 2 mutations, and MGMT promoter methylation] are currently the most important clinical markers in managing malignant gliomas.” —Matthias Holdhoff, MD, PhD The 2018 NCCN Guidelines incorporate molecular characteristics and pathologic characteristics in the staging and treatment of anaplastic gliomas. Testing for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and co-deletion of 1p and 19q is now a key element in the diagnostic workup of gliomas based on the recently published World Health Organization classification on brain tumors of 2016.   Matthias Holdhoff, MD, PhD The highest level of evidence for the treatment of newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendrogliomas with co-deletion of 1p and 19q has the regimen of radiation and chemotherapy with PCV (procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine). An ongoing prospective trial in these cancers, the so-called CODEL trial, is formally comparing this regimen with the somewhat better tolerated regimen of radiation and temozolomide (which is the current standard regimen for glioblastomas), explained Matthias Holdhoff, MD, PhD , of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore. Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Emphasis on Genetics “It is becoming increasingly important to become aware not only of a particular mutation but of the spectrum of mutations that occurs in a given patient [with acute myeloid leukemia]. They have important interactions that lead to dramatic differences in overall survival.” —Martin S. Tallman, MD   Martin S. Tallman, MD The diagnosis, staging, and treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have evolved based on the identification of important genetic alterations and drugs to target those genes. Cytogenetic abnormalities are the main concern in managing AML, explained Martin S. Tallman, MD , of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. Among important genetic aberrations are CEBP-alpha , FLT3 , IDH1 , IDH2 , P53 , and NPM1 . The company these genetic abnormalities keep—ie, their combinations—affects prognosis. Four drug approvals of novel agents have improved outcomes in patients with AML: midostaurin (Rydapt; targeted to FLT3 ), gemtuzumab (for CD33-positive AML), CPX-351 (a 5:1 formulation of daunorubicin/cytarabine for treatment-naive patients), and isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) inhibitors enasidenib and ivosidenib (for relapsed or refractory patients with IDH mutations). Achieving minimal residual disease is recognized as an increasingly important milestone. ■ DISCLOSURE: For full disclosures of all speakers, visit https://www.nccn.org/disclosures/guidelinepanellisting.aspx .",tagrisso,Cancer Treatment and Management,POSITIVE,0.8,"osimertinib (Tagrisso) and the ALK inhibitor alectinib (Alecensa), as first-line preferences."
"The investigational anti-α4β7 integrin antibody abrilumab in different doses significantly improved 8-week remission rates versus placebo in refractory patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC), a phase IIb trial found. Significant improvements were also observed in clinical response and mucosal healing at week 8, according to the international team of researchers. ""Our data further support the mechanism of targeting the anti-α4β7 pathway as a therapeutic option for the management of moderate to severe UC and the use of anti-α4β7 levels as a potential prognostic indicator in UC,"" wrote William J. Sandborn, MD, of the University of California San Diego, and colleagues. As they explained in their study online in Gastroenterology , the influx of immune cells into gut mucosa, mediated through integrin-dependent leukocytes, plays an important role in IBD pathogenesis. The cellular adhesion molecule α4β7 integrin mediates stable adhesion to high endothelial venules and promotes lymphocyte migration across the endothelial wall. The team noted that restricting homing of lymphocytes to the gastrointestinal tract by blocking essential integrin-mediated interactions has been an area of intensive clinical research over the past 2 decades, and targeting gut-selective lymphocyte trafficking is a promising therapeutic strategy in IBD. Study Details During 2012-2015, Sandborn and co-authors recruited 359 patients with a mean age of 40 from 92 centers in North America, Europe, and Australia. Patients had a total Mayo Score of 6-12 and a rectosigmoidoscopy score of ≥2 with inadequate response or intolerance to immunosuppressives, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, and/or corticosteroids. Participants were randomized to receive subcutaneous abrilumab (7, 21, or 70 mg) on day 1, weeks 2 and 4, and every 4 weeks; abrilumab 210 mg on day 1; or placebo. Demographic and disease characteristics were similar across the three groups. The primary endpoint was remission (total Mayo Score ≤2 points, no individual subscore >1 point) for the two highest dosages at week 8. Key secondary endpoints were response and mucosal healing at week 8. After the initial double-blind phase, treatment continued through 24 weeks. Following randomization, a total of 354 patients were included in the 8-week double-blind phase. Of these, 238 patients received ≥1 dose of the investigational drug and 116 received placebo. By week 8, 332 patients had completed the initial phase. The non-adjusted remission rates were 4.3% for the placebo group and 13.3% and 12.7%, for the abrilumab 70-mg and 210-mg groups, respectively ( P <0.05 for both doses versus placebo). That translated into an odds ratio (OR) of achieving remission with abrilumab 70 mg of 3.35 (90% CI 1.41-7.95, P =0.021) and with 210 mg of 3.33 (90% CI1.34- 8.26, P =0.030). The authors noted, however, that these rates were lower than the 21% anticipated in the sample size calculation. The 8-week clinical response and mucosal healing rates at the two higher doses were also significantly greater versus placebo, with ORs of 2.78 at 70 mg and 2.57 at 210 mg. The odds of mucosal healing were also higher: ORs of 2.34 and 2.10, respectively. Adverse event rates were comparable across groups through treatment week 24, with 68% of placebo recipients and 63% of abrilumab recipients reporting at least one treatment-emergent adverse event of any grade. The safety profile is comparable to that of vedolizumab (Entyvio), the authors noted. Higher baseline concentrations of the antibody were a favorable prognostic indicator in UC disease activity and Mayo Score response, but not a predictive biomarker of abrilumab response. No cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or deaths occurred. The researchers cited several limitations to the study, including a systematic misalignment of treatments that led some patients randomized to the abrilumab 7-mg group to erroneously receive 70 mg, and some randomized to the 21-mg group to erroneously receive placebo. These patients were analyzed based on the actual treatment received with no impairment of blinding and minimal change to the study's power of detection, Sandborn and co-authors noted. Additionally, they said, because the study was short term, it did not fully evaluate continued treatment following induction of remission at 8 weeks. ""Although we observed a trend toward treatment effect at week 24 for the 70-mg multi-dose group, longer-term phase III studies evaluating clinical remission and response rates beyond 24 weeks are required to draw conclusions on the durability of treatment response,"" the researchers wrote. ""Finally, conclusions regarding treatment responses based on previous TNF antagonist treatment are limited, but initial findings suggested potential benefit in both naive and exposed patients.""",entyvio,Cancer Treatment and Management,NEUTRAL,0.8,The study suggests that the safety profile of abrilumab is comparable to that of vedolizumab (Entyvio).
"My mom was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at age 43 in October 2015. Around that time I was 23, just graduated college and passed my CPA exams. I moved to NYC to start my career in public accounting. My mom's case was severe, she was a single parent without health insurance and always put her kids first (I am the oldest of 3, with two brothers who are now 21 and 9). As a result, by the time she sought treatment and was diagnosed, her colon was so far gone that we didn't have a shot with humira or remicade. By November 2015 the pain was so severe my mom's body could no longer handle the strain of working in the food industry and she had to quit. In February 2016 she started the first of her three surgeries for the end result being a proctocectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. She conquered her final procedure in December 2016 and we thought we were in the clear...finally the road to recovery! Unfortunately we were wrong. In addition to the extreme emotional and mental changes I have seen in her, she has had severe complications with her eyes and lungs that came to fruition relatively quickly post operation. Her cough is so severe that she has fractured her ribs twice now. It's sad and scary that at age 45 she can't walk more than a block without being out of breath. To all of this the doctors have been unable to definitively conclude on a treatment and simply attribute it to her ""UC and auto immune disease"". To make matters worse my mom is a financial mess. She was granted disability in April 2017, but before that went without pay since November 2015. Her current situation is not sustainable to cover her rent and provide for my 9 year old brother, etc. I feel like I'm at a dead end.

Does anyone have a loved one experiencing similar complications to my mom? If so, what is their medical routine? My mom sees a therapist, rheumatologist, ophthalmologist, PCP...

"Tashia, In responding to a post, you can quote the specific post you are interested in. But, in your case, a good way to use your site is to post in the Introduce Yourself section of our forum. On the upper right side of the introductory page, you should see a Start new topic box. Checking that and posting allows everyone to see your story and realize you are new. From your description of your uncle's treatment, it sounds like he is receiving first-line standard of care treatment for inoperable Stage IV lung cancer. He is receiving combination chemotherapy -- conventional chemo paired with Keytruda, a very effective immunotherapy drug. As Steff reported on her mother's immunotherapy treatment, this combination can be very effective. So others here can provide first hand information, you might tell us about the type of lung cancer your uncle has. You have 3 questions: will this treatment improve his quality of life; will it prolong his life; and will it cure or stop his cancer? Life quality in treatment depends on a lot of factors: age, general health condition, complicating serious illness, and many more. If his first line treatment works, his life quality will improve. You've already reported some improvement in his breathing. Will treatment prolong life? That is the goal and for very many, prolonged life is achieved. In my case, treatment has allowed me to live almost 15 years beyond diagnosis. Can the treatment cure? We don't use the cure word in the lung cancer community but rather use the term no evidence of disease or NED. Yes, this treatment can allow your uncle to achieve NED. It is not unusual for other nodules to occur while receiving immunotherapy treatment. It takes time for the immune system to be primed to recognize cancer cells and during early treatment, scans often show tumor growth or new metastasis. How long is your uncle's treatment period? What are the other drugs he is receiving besides Keytruda? Welcome here. We hope your uncle's treatment resolves his lung cancer. Stay the course. Tom Tom My Uncle is on a 3 month treatment period. He is at his 2nd month point. I believe they are to do another scan this coming Friday. He is having two types of Chemo and Keytruda, that is only drugs they are giving him.

"Now with more current data, the concept of pseudoprogression is a concern for many oncologists from the other side of the equation - waiting too long for immuno to work can be a mistake. Here's a recent article by Dr. Jack West of Cancer Grace. Different cancers have different pseudoprogression rates. In melanoma, it can be fairly significant. In lung cancer, it's between 1 and 3 percent. http://cancergrace.org/lung/2016/09/12/death-by-pseudoprogression-knowing-w hen-to-cut-your-losses-with-immunotherapy/#more-17624 Along the same thinking, here's a quote from a lung cancer presentation by Dr. Eddie Garon, in which he says, ""One other important issue to address is this issue of pseudoprogression, and this is something that people in the immunotherapy field have talked about for a long time, that if you have an effective immunotherapy, that you may have immune cells that infiltrate into the tumor and, as a result, rather than getting smaller, that the tumor would actually get larger. That could certainly happen over a short period of time, but what I would say, to date, is it’s not something we’ve seen a lot in lung cancer. Our colleagues in melanoma certainly report this as being a significant issue — patients who will have initial growth of their tumor on imaging, and then, afterwards, will have shrinking. We certainly do have several intriguing anecdotes, sort of individual patients that people will describe who have had, sort of, increases in their tumor volume, but then get better, but I would say that it is actually quite uncommon in lung cancer. So, the dilemma continues to be do we roll the dice if there's some progression and continue for a while, or move onto the next line of treatment? In my case, the first scan after two rounds of Keytruda, showed ""mixed"" results (some progression, some shrinkage, some hint of perhaps new things). Since my PD-1 expression is so high (90%) and because my performance status continues to be zero, oncologist and I decided to keep going for another three infusions and then rescan. He said, ""Conventional wisdom would tell us to move on to something else."" So, we're bucking conventional wisdom for now , with full understanding that it's a risk.

Preventing the entry of these cells into the CNS reduces inflammatory damage to nerve cells.

"Hi Dutch46, I hope someone who has used nivolumab in this context can chime in, because I don’t have an good data to share with you on its efficacy in mBAC, but Dr. Evan Lipson of Johns Hopkins presented some good information on managing immunotherapy side effects in this podcast. I checked out the PD-L1 Blueprint Project assay comparison paper; thanks for pointing out that interesting study. It illuminates the issue of just how slippery the distinction between high and low PD-L1 expression can be, as well as the still-open question of how well does the level of expression predict response to treatment. Different trials use varying cutoffs between high and low, and as the report states, the experience of the pathologist with a particular assay can be a factor. It’s certainly doubtful that a patient just above the chosen threshold will fare significantly better than one just below it. Although it may not provide much comfort to you and your wife, who were hoping to get the trial drug, in almost two-thirds of the small number of cases there was agreement between all four assays, and by one practical standard, the assay chosen might only have affected inclusion in about 15% of the cases.

"Cancer immunotherapy is going from strength to strength, as first and second generation therapies that alert the immune system to hidden tumours by switching off checkpoint controls continue to have spectacular success in the clinic. Inevitably there have been setbacks, as many patients do not respond, or cannot tolerate the often toxic side effects of treatment, but a future where immunotherapy replaces chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for many cancers seems likely. While there is still intense interest in further refining existing therapies targeting checkpoint controls, attention in both the academic and pharmaceutical sectors has also turned to the next big challenge: the problem of why some patients and tumour types are non-responders. The solution, according to many, lies in combination therapy – using both old and new ways of manipulating the anti-tumour immune response in concert with relief of checkpoint controls. Protocols combining immunotherapy with radio- and virotherapy are also being developed globally. The advent of immunotherapy is truly a step-change in our ability to treat many cancers. As the excitement settles into a consideration of how best to move forward, it has never been more important to support and develop the immunotherapy community within the UK. Of course, as in any field, scientists will always be the key to progress, but funding organisations also have an important part to play. CRUK has the resources and ambition to turn your ideas into patient benefit as quickly and efficiently as possible, so come and talk to us – we can help you to help us step into a new era of cancer therapy.  The Cancer-Immunity Cycle Once jump-started by immunotherapy, successful tumour killing needs the anti-cancer immune response to become self-driven. Aiding this crucial transition, whilst preventing it from running out of control, is the rationale behind combination therapy. For clarity, it’s helpful to consider the anti-cancer immune response as a cycle, as proposed by Dan Chen and Ira Mellman in an influential Immunity review in 2013. The Cancer-Immunity Cycle begins when cancer cell antigens are released (step 1), and presented to the immune system (step 2), resulting in priming and activation of T cells (step 3). Activated T cells must then migrate to and infiltrate the tumour (steps 4 and 5), where they bind to tumour cells (step 6), and collaborate with the innate immune system to kill them (step 7). Cell killing leads to the release of more cancer antigens, resulting in another revolution of the cycle. Each successive revolution amplifies the response. Steps 3 and 7 are the points in the cycle at which checkpoint controls can kick in, putting the brakes on the cycle and stopping it dead. The recent immunotherapeutic breakthroughs have resulted from the development of agents able to take these brakes off. The anti-CTL4 drug ipilimumab forces T cell activation at step 3, and the anti-PD1/PDL1 drugs nivolumab and pembrolizumab maintain activated anti-tumour T cells in a combat-ready state at step 7, by inhibiting T cell exhaustion and tolerance. Taking the brakes off means that therapeutics able to accelerate and amplify the cycle are now able to work more effectively.   Step 1: Release of cancer cell antigens Many existing targeted drugs currently being trialled as combination therapies focus on cancer cell killing, with concomitant release of antigens, but other modalities are increasingly in the spotlight. At The Institute of Cancer Research, Kevin Harrington is running a Phase III trial of T-VEC, an HSV-1-based oncolytic virotherapy, in combination with pembrolizumab for treatment of advanced melanoma. And in a different approach, a Trojan Horse oncolytic therapy is being explored at the University of Sheffield: work from the labs of Claire Lewis and Munitta Mutana, showing that a patient’s own macrophages can transport the oncolytic virus Ad[I/PPT-E1A] deep into the heart of prostate tumours, is now being taken into a CRUK-funded Phase I clinical trial led by Janet Brown, also in Sheffield, and in collaboration with our Centre for Drug Development (CDD). Combined radio- and immunotherapy is attracting attention, due to the abscopal effect, a phenomenon whereby on rare occasions localised radiotherapy together with relief of checkpoint blockade is associated with the regression of metastatic cancer at a distance.  Step 2: Cancer antigen presentation Vaccination, the traditional way of artificially presenting antigens to the immune system, is experiencing a resurgence. Therapeutic cancer vaccines have a long and largely unsatisfactory history, which in the light of our new understanding of checkpoint inhibition is now perfectly explicable; trying to rev up an immune system whose brakes are firmly applied was never going to be successful. However, as a combination therapy, vaccines are far more likely to work, and CRUK has some exciting prospects in the pipeline. One of these is the work of Alan Rickinson and colleagues at the University of Birmingham, whose long-term commitment to EBV vaccine development was recognised by the 2015 CRUK Translational Cancer Research Prize. Dendritic cells are the professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system, and using them as vectors to stimulate an immune response to cancer has had some success in the past. However, the need to laboriously culture dendritic cells from individual patients, and then load the cells in vitro with cancer antigens, has severely limited progress. Our CDD has an innovative take on this. In partnership with Asterias Biotherapeutics, they’ve developed an off the shelf approach where stem cells can be differentiated into dendritic cells, which are then loaded with telomerase, commonly upregulated in many tumours. The resulting vaccine, AST-VAC2, is being made in the CRUK Biotherapeutics Development Unit at Clare Hall, and is projected to enter a clinical trial in lung cancer in 2017.  Step 3: Priming and activation Step 3 is the point of the cycle at which the effector: regulatory T cell balance of the immune response is established. CTLA4-blocking antibodies such as ipilimumab move the balance over to favour effector T cells, allowing a more vigorous immune response, but anti-CTL4 blockade is not always effective. Alternatives, such as agonistic antibodies able to switch on positive regulators of effector T cells, are being trialled in combination therapies, but whilst promising, it’s too early to say whether such strategies will be widely applicable due to sometimes severe toxicity.  Steps 4 & 5: Infiltration of T cells into tumours Analysis of cancers where checkpoint inhibitors have been ineffective has shown that in some cases, notably pancreatic cancer, tumours can construct a fortress around themselves that immune cells cannot penetrate. In 2014, Doug Fearon and colleagues at our CRUK Cambridge Institute showed that pancreatic tumour cells are coated in the T-cell-excluding CXCL12 chemokine; remarkably, whilst anti-PDL1 therapy was ineffective, combining it with the CXCL12 inhibitor AMD3100 resulted in significant tumour shrinkage in a mouse model. Two years on, AMD3100 is going into Phase I clinical trials for pancreatic cancer both here and in the US, with a view to testing it in combination therapies. Glasgow-based CRUK scientists Jennifer Morton and Owen Sansom, working in collaboration with AstraZeneca have recently shown that this approach can be extended to other chemokines. In their labs, an experimental drug against the CXCR2 protein not only suppressed metastasis in a mouse model, but, just as for AMD3100, improved T cell entry into pancreatic tumours. In mice, combined inhibition of CXCR2 and PD1 significantly extended survival, making CXCR2 another excellent prospect for a therapeutic target.  Step 6: Recognition of cancer cells by T cells CAR-T cells, so called because they express artificial Chimaeric Antigen Receptors, can bind to and kill cancer cells. Using CRISPR to modify and introduce genes into cells means that such cell-based therapies are booming. Engineered receptors of all shapes and sizes are being developed, aimed at achieving better activation and killing, whilst ramping up the affinity and specificity with which the receptors recognise and bind their tumour targets. To increase efficacy, most are being considered in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, as are the therapies described below. In another approach to tumour recognition, dual specificity antibodies and connecting bi-specific T cell engagers (BiTEs) are being used as bridging molecules to grab hold of tumour and immune cells, bringing them close enough to activate the kill function of the immune cells. Those that have been trialled so far are showing high response rates, albeit often with high toxicity. CRUK is supporting several lines of work in this area, ranging from trials of next generation CAR-T cells for neuroblastoma (John Anderson at Great Ormond Street Hospital, sponsored and managed by our CDD) and pancreatic cancer (John Maher at UCL) to a company based around CAR-T therapy to disrupt tumour vasculature via binding to CLEC14a, a marker of tumour angiogenesis (Steven Lee and Roy Bicknell in Birmingham, in collaboration with CRT and the Cell Therapy Catapult).  Step 7: Killing of cancer cells The interaction of cancer cells with the tumour microenvironment, including the cells of the adaptive and innate immune systems, determines whether a tumour will survive and prosper or wither away. Whilst targeting the PD1/PDL1 checkpoint has been very successful, it’s clear that combining checkpoint inhibition with other strategies to mould the inflammatory microenvironment will be even more effective. A host of ideas are currently touted, particularly in the relatively unexplored area of innate immunity. There’s a lot of interest in manipulating inflammasomes, the signalling scaffolds that trigger cell killing by the innate immune system. Agonists are being developed to artificially activate the inflammatory response, although concerns about toxicity mean that any such therapies would have to be strictly topical, perhaps delivered by injection into the tumour.  The CRUK-MEDI Alliance Laboratory: Crowdsourcing new ideas in antibody therapy Monoclonal antibody-based drugs have provided the platform for the success of immunotherapeutic checkpoint inhibition. The exquisite specificity of antibody variable regions as a means of manipulating the immune system and its tumour targets, means that the role of antibody-based biotherapeutics has never been more important. The CRUK-MEDI Alliance Laboratory is testament to CRUK’s determination to put biotherapeutics front and centre of our research. The lab, a joint project between CRUK and MedImmune, is an opportunity to crowdsource ideas for new targets, and rapidly put them into practice. According to Rob Williams, Chief Drug Development Scientist for our Centre for Drug Development (CDD): “The philosophy is that we don’t know what’s coming next”, he says, “so we want to tap into the community to pick up exciting ideas, and turn them into novel biological therapeutics”. The lab specialises in phage display technology, which allows researchers to quickly scan through millions of randomly-generated antibodies to find ones that recognise important molecules involved in cancer. Maria Groves believes MedImmune is the perfect partner for such a strategy. “MedImmune provide 20 years of phage display expertise and in-depth knowledge of the technology and drug discovery and disease processes”, she says. But collaboration will be the key: “Building a network of principal investigators generating novel ideas for oncology therapeutics will be central to the success of this exciting new venture”, Maria continues. The lab has already reviewed over 20 applications, several of which are now major active projects. Whilst access to the lab was initially open only to CRUK-funded researchers, in autumn 2016, this will be opened up to all researchers. Rob’s message to the research community is clear: “We want people to think imaginatively about novel ways of using biotherapeutics to fight cancer, and to come to us with those ideas.

Since I am not familiar with the system in the UK, I was hoping someone could help me figure out how things are in terms of care and access to it. I was diagnosed with MS in September 2012 and have been on Gilenya ever since, with no relapses or major side effect. I was wondering if that's an established treatment in the UK and if anyone knows of any specialist in the area of Exeter who are familiar with it, since my neurologist strongly recommends that I don't switch medications. I am also concerned about the costs and the type of assistance I would be able to get within the NHS or some other private insurance, e.g. the cost of Gilenya itself, and of all the check-ups related to the medication and MS in general ( bi- or tri-monthly blood tests that are necessary with Gilenya, MRI scans, steroid treatments in case of a relapse, etc.) Can anyone tell me how straight-forward it is to obtain access to these services, using the infrastructure available in the Exeter area? Are there any specialists you can recommend? What would be the advantage, if any, to opt for a private insurance? Finally, there is the question of waiting times. Can anyone give me an indication of how long it would take me to get to see a specialist, and wether I can directly get in touch with them to schedule my first appointment? Do I need to register for NHS before-hand? I realize that these are quite a few and general questions, but already getting any information from people with first-hand experience with the system and the doctors in and around Exeter would be of great help. Thank you very much in advance to those who will take the time to reply to my questions :) Have a nice day, Laura",gilenya,Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Options,NEUTRAL,0.5,"access to care,cost of Gilenya,cost of check-ups,availability of specialists familiar with Gilenya,waiting times for specialist appointments,process of registering for NHS"
"Hi fbs123 I can only semi comment on Lemtrada - I am due in for round 1 on 25th June. You have to go on a listeria diet at least 4 months prior to treatment, but now a lot of hospitals now give you a super strong antibiotic to prevent listeria infection post treatment (i think you're on that for about 4 months post treatment) - luckily my hospital do give this. Its really, as with any drug, is weighing up risk and benefit. I cannot wait to get it! I want to hit this as hard as I can (I was diagnosed 10 odd years ago and have been on REBIF, Tysabri and fingolimod) Had a huge relapse after having a baby last year and was offered lemtrada then. I realise I am not much help - just wanted to respond. If I can answer any other questions, I will, but as I said - I havent started yet! Good luck with your decision.

"Yes, I haven’t had any treatments since 2016. I had several months of carboplatin and alimta, then 7 months of Xalkori and 5 months of Zykadia, followed by Alimta every three weeks for over a year. When no evidence of cancer anywhere and scar tissue only was where the cancer had once been, I stopped treatments. I still get scans every three weeks. Next one due in March.

"Remember too that tapering off of steroids can lead to a lot of fatigue. You've been tapering down from 60mg while you've been on the Entyvio, so it's possible that is the cause. If it persists for several weeks after you've fully tapered off the pred, then it might be the Entyvio. But right now I'd say it's more likely the UC itself or the pred taper.",entyvio,Lung Cancer Diagnosis and Management,NEUTRAL,0.6,tapering off of steroids can lead to a lot of fatigue
"Mri usefullness ""We also assessed the predictive value of MRI metrics commonly measured in MS clinical trials over 2-year intervals, and found no association between new T2 lesions or gadolinium-DPTA–enhanced lesions and worse long-term outcomes."" Edss increase over 2 yeras its not predictive ""Similarly, an increase in the EDSS score over 2 years was not associated with worse long-term prognosis. Thus, short-term increases in EDSS do not necessarily predict future accumulation of disability in RMS patients over the longer term, a conclusion also reached in a pooled analysis of patients randomized to placebo arms in 31 clinical trials.48"" Neda (For what ?) ""Because neither clinical nor radiographic features over 2 years had predictive value, it is not surprising that the combined measure of these variables, NEDA, was also not associated with long-term disability risk. Although this observation must be interpreted with caution because of the relatively small number of NEDA patients in our cohort, another recently published observational study also found that the proportion of patients meeting a NEDA definition declined substantially over time.49 These observations challenge the concept that NEDA represents remission. Although NEDA may be a useful measure for assessing relative therapeutic efficacy, many patients who meet NEDA criteria over 2 years go on to develop clinically significant disability. Worsening in patients who meet the 2-year NEDA endpoint could result from active spinal cord disease not captured with brain MRI, progressive axonal or neuronal degeneration, or an escape from a true but transient remission state. A recent study that incorporated thresholds for acceptable brain volume loss for NEDA found that one-third of NEDA patients treated with fingolimod still experienced significant brain volume loss during the NEDA interval, indicating that ongoing tissue injury occurs in NEDA patients.50"" Long-Term Evolution of Multiple Sclerosis Disability in the Treatment Era ANN NEUROL 2016;80:499–510 Obrigado",fingolimod,Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of MS Treatments,NEUTRAL,0.6,"active spinal cord disease not captured with brain MRI,progressive axonal or neuronal degeneration,escape from a true but transient remission state,ongoing tissue injury"
