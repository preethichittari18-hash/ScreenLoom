"Why do you think that FIngolimod was such a miserable failure in progressive MS trial in humans (not animals) that was aborted by Biogen? If it is in fact stimulating neuronal gene expression, axon growth and regeneration, which is what you want in progressive patients, why do human trials fail?",fingolimod
"Lemtrada is for any form of MS with relapses. Reversal of current damage is seen in anyone with natural neuronal reserve. Reversal becomes evident because the disease progression is finally halted and even small reversals become evident for the first time in a long time. It should definitely be on the table. IMO Just an FYI, Cladribine did not complete safety testing which is required by the FDA and EMA that gives long term data of significant SEs like thyroid disorders and cancers that may be produced by a DMT during extended tests. Short term tests were very positive but unfortunately not enough for drug approval. Cladribine patent protection was apparently only for a few more years so the costs to conduct the phase III testing could not be justified. The Pharma that developed Cladribine decided to pull the plug instead of funding the required tests.",cladribine
"I wonder if anyone has ever combined two biologics? Humira and Stelara for example.... Can't find any data on that notion. I guess it requires the cooperation of competing company's products, so is unlikely to be tested.",stelara
"I was diagnosed with stage 4 adeno lung cancer in 2009. I had 15 hits of radiation to the tumor in my right lung, then started on Carbo, Taxol and Avastin followed by six cycles of Gemzar for two nodules in my liver. I also had a spot on the apex region of my left lung. In 2010 I was given 150 mg Tarceva and it has worked up until November of last year. I was never tested for mutations in 2009, so my first request when they found a 1.2 cm tumor in my left lung was to do genomic sequencing. I had the biopsy done at Kaiser Hospital and then had my tissue sent to Foundation Medicine. I also had a blood draw and had a liquid biopsy done with Gardant Health. Foundation One report showed none of the standard mutations and only six alterations NTRK1, PIK3CA, ATM, MCL1, TAF1 and TP53. Gardant 360 showed only a EGFR amplification.  I have done some research on NTRK1 and PIK3CA alterations. When I spoke with MD Anderson they said the LOX-101 trial for NTRK1 was getting good results with fusion, but without fusion like me they only had one person in the trail. They mentioned that even if I enrolled in a clinical trial they would probably try me on immunotherapy first. I started on Opdivo at Kaiser and am receiving my second infusion today. I feel I will do well on Opdivo since I was a past smoker. Testing was done on my tissue for PD-L1 expression, but the results are still out. I know good results are coming in with and without expression. I have sought out second opinions and I am hearing  if Opdivo doesnât work my best option would be to focus on the PIK3CA alteration in some type of combo clinical trial. My questions are should I be looking at the PIK3CA alteration as my plan B? If so what would be by best course of treatment?

"Here's the latest update. My husband certainly feels like he is in remission with the Xeljanz. No UC symptoms -- for the first time in almost three years. No urgency, no cramping, no bleeding. Able to leave the house for work in the morning no worries. Previously, he had not been able to get below 22.5 mg prednisone without flaring. With the Xeljanz, had tapered down to 2.5 mg but was pretty sick -- not UC symptoms but clearly his adrenal glands haven't kicked in yet. Back up to 5 mg and meeting with doc this week to figure out how to get off the prednisone. No apparent side effects from Xeljanz, either. Hoping this one is the charm but if it is not, going to surgery with no regrets. Spouse diagnosed with UC in 2013. Developed antibodies to remicade, humira. Entyvio did not work after 6 infusions. Only thing that seemed to work was prednisone. Early March 2016 started Xeljanz off label. It is working. No more UC symptoms, but still fearful of foods that triggered symptoms before (like fruits and vegetables). Getting completely off prednisone is the current challenge.",entyvio
"Hello, I approached the MS Barts health team for off-label cladribine in January this year. I had to go through the usual protocols, brain and spinal cord MRI and a lumbar puncture. In mid May I had a follow up appointment with the MS consultant. I was told that I am not eligible because there are no active lesions on my MRI scans and there was no evidence of inflamation in the lumbar puncture. There needs to be evidence that my MS is active before I am eligible for prescribing off-label cladribine. Yes I was gutted, in fact as he spoke to me I felt as if I had just been thrown onto a scrap heap. Then I thought about things on the journey home and actually I felt quite relieved. If the consultant could see no evidence that my MS is active then actually I am lucky. I might be disabled, I am medically retired, cannot walk unaided and am the proud owner of a Blue Badge but things could be a lot worse. Yup things could be a whole lot worse for me, none the less my MS is progressing. 6 years ago I could walk a few hundred metres without a stick, no chance of that today; I must always use a rollator and even then its not very far on a flat even surface. If I bend down then I fall over and I now suffer from fatigue. Just gotta be positive. Patrick aid4disabled.com",cladribine
"It is highly undestandable that anyone with AMD, be it wet or dry feels depressed. I hope you all have a good retinal consultant.

"– Novartis today announced positive results of the Phase III EXPAND study showing that oral once-daily BAF312 (siponimod) significantly reduced the risk of confirmed disability progression compared with placebo in people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). SPMS is a form of MS characterized by continuous worsening of neurological function over time, independent of relapses. Topline results of EXPAND were presented at the 32 nd Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) in London, UK. BAF312 is an investigational selective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Initial, first interpretable data from the EXPAND study show:  · Treatment with BAF312 reduced the risk of three-month confirmed disability progression by 21% compared with placebo (p=0.013). The risk reduction for six-month confirmed disability progression was greater, further supporting robustness of the data. · A consistent reduction in the risk of three-month confirmed disability progression across predefined subgroups. · A significant difference in favor of BAF312 compared to placebo over 12 and 24 months in annualized relapse rate, the percent change in brain volume, and change from baseline in the volume of T2 lesions (brain lesions identified by a T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan). The difference in change from baseline in the timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW) was not significant. · BAF312 was generally safe and well tolerated, with a profile comparable to other drugs in the same class. “There are very few available treatment options to delay disease progression in SPMS, and there is a high unmet need for effective therapies with an acceptable safety profile for people with the condition,” said Vasant Narasimhan, Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer for Novartis. “Novartis is the global leader in understanding the role of S1P receptor modulation in the treatment of MS, and the positive results of the EXPAND study are a continuation of our ongoing efforts to innovate and meet the needs of patients . These data are a positive stride forward in an unserved disease area, and we look forward to evaluating next steps with health authorities.” EXPAND is the largest randomized, controlled study in SPMS to date. Patients enrolled in EXPAND were representative of a general SPMS population. They must have been diagnosed with SPMS and also demonstrated progression of disability in the two years prior to study. The majority of patients had non-relapsing SPMS. The mean age at study entry was 48 years, and patients had a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 6.0, which corresponds to the use of a walking aid. Novartis will complete full analyses of the EXPAND data and evaluate next steps in consultation with health authorities. The full study results, including data from primary and secondary endpoints, will be submitted for publication.  About the EXPAND Study The EXPAND study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study, comparing the efficacy and safety of BAF312 versus placebo in people with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). It is the largest randomized, controlled study in SPMS to date, and included 1,651 people with SPMS from 31 countries. At the time of the study, individuals enrolled in EXPAND had a mean age of 48 years and had been living with MS for approximately 17 years. Patients had received a diagnosis of SPMS, and also demonstrated progression of disability in the two years prior to study. They also had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 and 6.5 inclusive, with a median score of 6.0, which corresponds to the use of a walking aid. Patients were randomized to receive either 2mg BAF312 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study was the time to three-month confirmed disability progression, as measured by the EDSS, versus placebo. Secondary endpoints included delay in the time to six-month confirmed disability progression based on EDSS versus placebo, the time to confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in the timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW), T2 lesion volume, annualized relapse rate (ARR), and the safety and tolerability of BAF312 in people with SPMS.  About BAF312 (siponimod) BAF312 (siponimod) is an investigational selective modulator of specific types of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor. The S1P receptor is commonly found on the surface of specific cells residing in the central nervous system (CNS), that are responsible for causing CNS damage that drives loss of function in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). In-vitro studies show that BAF312 enters the brain and by binding to these specific receptors, may prevent the activation of these harmful cells, helping to reduce loss of physical and cognitive function associated with SPMS.  About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss. The evolution of MS results in an increasing loss of both physical (e.g., walking) and cognitive (e.g., memory) function. There are three types of MS: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). SPMS is characterized by gradual worsening of neurological function over time. This leads to a progressive accumulation of disability, independent of relapses, which can severely affect patients’ abilities to carry out everyday activities. It usually follows an initial phase of RRMS, which accounts for approximately 85% of all MS diagnoses; a quarter of people with RRMS will eventually go on to develop SPMS within 10 years of their initial RRMS diagnosis, rising to more than three-quarters after 30 years. There remains a high unmet need for effective and safe treatments to help delay disability progression in SPMS. MS affects around 400,000 people in the US.  About Novartis in Multiple Sclerosis The Novartis multiple sclerosis (MS) portfolio includes Gilenya (fingolimod, an S1P modulator), which is indicated for relapsing forms of MS and is also in development for pediatric MS. Extavia ® (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is approved in the US for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. In Europe, Extavia is approved to treat people with relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with active disease and people who have had a single clinical event suggestive of MS. In addition to BAF312 (siponimod) in development in SPMS, investigational compounds include ofatumumab (OMB157), a fully human monoclonal antibody in development for relapsing MS. Ofatumumab targets CD20, and is currently being investigated in two Phase III pivotal studies.

"Hi petes, Welcome to Grace.  I’m so very sorry your wife is dealing with this diagnosis. Alectinib is definitely worth a try.  Also alimta may be a choice especially if she hasn’t progressed on it I’ve found it to be a very risky business to 2nd guess oneself after the fact.  No one will ever know whether it was the drugs or the radiation that stopped your wife’s brain mets.  I tend to believe that an assumption that it was a little of everything that did the job so there’s really nothing to regret.  Sometimes the games we play with the mind are a very effective treatment for patients and loved ones,  Another hopeful way to look at the new treatment is the fact that those who respond well to treatment tend to respond well to other treatments…responders respond.

I was on Humira and it didn't do anything for my flare. Before that I was on Imuran and that didn't help either. I hear it works really fast for some and they get relief. I didn't. Wasn't a fan of...,humira
"""For the record"": It was not only MD Stephen Hauser who tried to cool down the hype around this immunosupressive agent ocrelizumab. Several other MD´s have been catious about this ms agent. In my Point of view, there have been to many get carried away views on this agent. It will only up in disapointments for those patients who are willing to take the risk with this Ocrelizumab (CD 20) agent. And as for criticizing prof G earlier statement about the fatc, that many RRMS patients who were on Rituximab progressed to SPMS, all according to MD Stephen Hauser, I think, no offence ment, you really splitting hairs. The essence of the content remains: obviously, at least the well respected MD Stephen Hauser have some doubts about Rituximab abilities to prevent RRMS patients to progress into SPMS. And since Ocrelizumab and Rituximab have the same Mode of action (CD20), it raises really some serious questions about Ocrelizumabs abilities to prevent CDP/EDSS in this RRMS patients The only ""error"" or ""mistake"" prof G made, was that you, and maybe others, were given the impression that MD Hauser made this statement publicly on stage. But it was mentioned to Prof G directly off stage in dialogue with MD Stephen Hauser: So the fact that many of MD Stephen Hauser patients treated with rituximab have developed SPMS remains. So essentially prof G was correct in his original statement with regard to that fact. Lastly, on balance, I think this signature Wheelchair Kamikaze contributed with a good post on the subject last month. http://www.wheelchairkamikaze.com/2016/03/ocrelizumab-ppms-trial-data-released.html",ocrelizumab

I’m on Ocrevus which is technically Rituxan’s sister. I was on Rituxan but my insurance wouldn’t cover it because it isn’t technically approved for MS. I’d rather Rituxan but they are almost the same. I was wondering if the drug choice had anything to do with the fatigue symptom.,ocrevus
"I am due in March for my full dose infusion of Ocrevus .

I had issues every time my infusion was scheduled. Now I’m going back to Rituxan at the full dosage. Rituxan which is technically not approved for MS but I’d prefer to be on for safety reasons. I’ve explained my reasoning why in my blog post here http://www.multipleexperiences.org/2018/11/15/rituxan-instead-of-ocrevus/ . It also has the blog that compares the two drugs. Ironically, Rituxan was on the list of covered prescription medication from my pharmacy and we had to get special approval for Ocrevus. Yet, it may not be a covered prescription medicine for me with MS. Therefore we might still need special approval’s. I’m trying to be proactive and start this process early but I can guarantee I’ll be writing blogs that my infusion has been postponed or I still have to be on Ocrevus. Not the most positive attitude but I have a lot of past experience. Infusion is scheduled mid March.",ocrevus
"Hi all, when i started remicade i had a great response to it pretty much overnight. The abdominal pain, urgency, blood, diarrhea, and everything else was gone within the first day. I felt great and I was so happy it was working. A week before the third infusion, though, some symptoms started to come back, as in the blood, mushier stools, etc. Then, a day before the infusion, the bloody diarrhea came back, going 4 times in that day. I thought the infusion would bring me some much needed relief as it had the first two times, but that was not the case. Now, it’s 3 days after the infusion and my symptoms are still present - diarrhea about 3-4 times a day, sometimes with blood, stomach pains, and urgency. Although i do think the blood has gone down a bit. Could I already be developing antibodies? Or could this just be a delayed response to it? What could it be? I just want life to be like what it was when the remicade was working. I am just so frustrated.",remicade
"Humira ( adalimumab ) is an injectable protein (antibody) used to treat rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile idiopathic arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , and plaque psoriasis . Humira is also used to treat Crohn's disease after other drugs have been tried without successful treatment of symptoms. Common side effects of Humira include  injection site reactions (redness, itching, pain, bruising, swelling, or bleeding), headache, suffy nose, sinus pain, or stomach pain.

The most common adverse reaction with HUMIRA was injection site reactions. In placebocontrolled trials, 20% of patients treated with HUMIRA developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in patients with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RAII, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for patients taking HUMIRA and 4% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of HUMIRA in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%).  Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global HUMIRA clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 HUMIRA-treated patients versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated patients. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and postsurgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ].  Tuberculosis And Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 HUMIRA-treated patients, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian HUMIRA-treated patients, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ].  Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of patients treated with HUMIRA and 7% of placebo-treated patients that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two patients out of 3046 treated with HUMIRA developed clinical signs suggestive of newonset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with HUMIRA on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in patients receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (40 mg SC every other week) in patients with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.5% of controltreated patients. Since many of these patients in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between HUMIRA and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of HUMIRA in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of HUMIRA and MTX than those treated with HUMIRA alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of HUMIRA treatment. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of HUMIRA in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with CD with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 0.9% of control-treated patients. In the Phase 3 trial of HUMIRA in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these patients discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in patients with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.0% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in patients with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients. In controlled trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of HUMIRA-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in HUMIRA-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients.  Immunogenicity Patients in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab during the 6- to 12-month period. Approximately 5% (58 of 1062) of adult RA patients receiving HUMIRA developed low-titer antibodies to adalimumab at least once during treatment, which were neutralizing in vitro. Patients treated with concomitant methotrexate (MTX) had a lower rate of antibody development than patients on HUMIRA monotherapy (1% versus 12%). No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients. The long-term immunogenicity of HUMIRA is unknown. In patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years of age, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 16% of HUMIRA-treated patients. In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence was 6% compared to 26% with HUMIRA monotherapy. In patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7% (1 of 15) of HUMIRA-treated patients, and the one patient was receiving concomitant MTX. In patients with AS, the rate of development of antibodies to adalimumab in HUMIRA-treated patients was comparable to patients with RA. In patients with PsA, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA monotherapy was comparable to patients with RA; however, in patients receiving concomitant MTX the rate was 7% compared to 1% in RA. In adult patients with CD, the rate of antibody development was 3%. In pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA was 3%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 32% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 10%. In patients with moderately to severely active UC, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA was 5%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 25% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 20.7%. In patients with Ps, the rate of antibody development with HUMIRA monotherapy was 8%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 40% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 20.7%. In Ps patients who were on HUMIRA monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal. Anti-adalimumab antibodies were measured in clinical trials of subjects with moderate to severe HS with two assays (an original assay capable of detecting antibodies when serum adalimumab concentrations declined to < 2 mcg/mL and a new assay that is capable of detecting antiadalimumab antibody titers in all subjects, independent of adalimumab concentration). Using the original assay, the rate of anti-adalimumab antibody development in subjects treated with HUMIRA was 6.5%. Among subjects who stopped HUMIRA treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied), the immunogenicity rate was 28%. Using the new titer-based assay, antiadalimumab antibody titers were measurable in 61% of HS subjects treated with HUMIRA. Antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed. In adult patients with non-infectious uveitis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 4.8% (12/249) of patients treated with adalimumab. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/Ml (approximately 23% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 21.1%. Using an assay which could measure an anti-adalimumab antibody titer in all patients, titers were measured in 39.8% (99/249) of non-infectious uveitis adult patients treated with adalimumab. No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to adalimumab or titers, and are highly dependent on the assay. The observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to adalimumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.  Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to HUMIRA in 2468 patients, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). HUMIRA was studied primarily in placebo- controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients received 40 mg HUMIRA every other week. Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in patients treated with HUMIRA 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥5% of Patients Treated with HUMIRA During Placebo-Controlled Period of Pooled RA Studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV)  HUMIRA 40 mg subcutaneous Every Other Week (N=705) Placebo (N=690) Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection 17% 13% Sinusitis 11% 9% Flu syndrome 7% 6% Gastrointestinal Nausea 9% 8% Abdominal pain 7% 4% Laboratory Tests* Laboratory test abnormal 8% 7% Hypercholesterolemia 6% 4% Hyperlipidemia 7% 5% Hematuria 5% 4% Alkaline phosphatase increased 5% 3% Other Headache 12% 8% Rash 12% 6% Accidental injury 10% 8% Injection site reaction ** 8% 1% Back pain 6% 4% Urinary tract infection 8% 5% Hypertension 5% 3% * Laboratory test abnormalities were reported as adverse reactions in European trials ** Does not include injection site erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling Less Common Adverse Reactions In Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in HUMIRA-treated patients in RA studies were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder  Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder  Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the HUMIRA-treated patients in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , ADVERSE REACTIONS ]. Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, HUMIRA was studied in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of patients within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with HUMIRA and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of patients experienced an infection while receiving HUMIRA with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in HUMIRA-treated patients were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA patients who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this patient population treated with HUMIRA were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in patients receiving HUMIRA was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of HUMIRA treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of patients and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of patients treated with HUMIRA who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No patient developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of patients treated with HUMIRA developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several patients. CPK levels decreased or returned to normal in all patients. Most patients were able to continue HUMIRA without interruption. In Study JIA-II, HUMIRA was studied in 32 patients who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this patient population was similar to the safety profile seen in patients 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of patients experienced an infection while receiving HUMIRA. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of patients receiving HUMIRA in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of patients and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity.  Psoriatic Arthritis And Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 395 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebocontrolled trials and in an open label study and in 393 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies. The safety profile for patients with PsA and AS treated with HUMIRA 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA, HUMIRA Studies RA-I through IV.  Adult Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 1478 adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in four placebocontrolled and two open-label extension studies. The safety profile for adult patients with CD treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA.  Pediatric Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 192 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease in one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study. The safety profile for pediatric patients with Crohn's disease treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in adult patients with Crohn's disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with HUMIRA were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving HUMIRA in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving HUMIRA in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions.  Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 1010 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in two placebocontrolled studies and one open-label extension study. The safety profile for patients with UC treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA.  Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies. The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, HUMIRA-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%).  Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebocontrolled studies and one open-label extension study. The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with HUMIRA weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of HUMIRA. Flare of HS, defined as ≥25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from HUMIRA treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies.  Uveitis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 464 adult patients with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric patients with uveitis (Study PUV-I). The safety profile for patients with UV treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA.  Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HUMIRA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to HUMIRA exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis",humira

"You definitely need to be optimistic. I wrote to you before, I had tried Ocrevus. Not sure you remember me or not. I’m not offended if you don’t. The reason I am telling you that is to remind you that there is ALWAYS hope. i told you about the ECT treatments I received. We have been through a lot, I mean, more than I care to remember, but, we have made it. In November of 2006, my husband was told to make final plans for me. After my appendix burst, I developed a fistula and had about 15 surgeries to take care of sepsis. BUT, I lived, I am almost whole (minus a belly button), I have 2 sons, 5 grandchildren and 1 on the way. Life is good, no very good!!

"I was on Tysabri for four years. I was very hopeful that it would do great things for me when I first started on it but I deteriorated a lot while I having it. I came off it when my PML risk got too high but I wish I’d come off it earlier. I had discussed going on Lemtrada with my neuro before I was taken off Tysabri and he was happy for me to do that. When I read the stuff about what happens while you’re having Lemtrada and straight afterwards, I got scared. My walking was so poor, I couldn’t imagine how I would manage if it got worse, even for a few weeks. I was also scared that my bladder control would get worse again and this would be a huge problem because it takes me so long to walk to the loo. I read about Cladribine and decided it was a better bet for me. That did mean I had to wait to see Dr Schmierer at Barts – he’s not my regular neuro. So I made the decisions about my treatment, armed with knowledge from the Barts Blogspot. Reading the comments about the doctors’ plan to close it down, I get the impression I’m not the only person who has done this.",cladribine
"Hello Everyone! Just posting to let you all know I will be receiving my first Ocrevus infusion this Thursday. I'm a little nervous since I'm not entirely sure what I am in for, but hopefully everything will be okay. I was unhappy to learn that the 5 hour process will take 6 hours according to the infusion center rep. Being as I am bed-bound I can't imagine what it will be like if I don't have a place to lay down. No way I can sit in a recliner the entire time. The woman I spoke to by phone said they do have beds but she was vague and I didn't remember to mention I would probably be needing one. She was talking very fast and told me a couple of times how busy they are. It didn't seem like there would be a place for Curt to be with me, but maybe I am mistaken. Agate I will try to remember all the details as you requested in an earlier thread seems like I will have plenty of time to make notes.   My infusion will begin at 10:00 am and I am hoping the time passes as quickly as possible. I'd appreciate any helpful comments by those who have been down this road already.

"Barts is pretty horrible to get to (if you're a wheelchair user, particularly). But the medical staff are great there and very keen to give people Cladribine. They give you a form where you specify that you would prefer Cladribine to other medications. I wish I had been able to choose Cladribine rather than Tysabri - still I suppose it's all water under the bridge now.

"Hi sezz, It’s terrific that your partner has had such a good response to Opdivo, but it’s not at all unusual in such cases to skip treatments or increase the interval between treatments in order to minimize side effects. The half-life of a drug is simply the amount of time it takes until only half of the drug remains in the body. I wouldn’t put too much faith in the description of half-life as the time that the drug is effective. When new drugs are tested in trials, the eventual recommended dosage is set at the maximum tolerated dose, rather than the minimum effective dose. That’s because the effective dose for each particular patient may differ, so the thought is that if you give everyone the maximum dose most patients can tolerate, you maximize the chance of a good response for all patients. The disadvantage of this approach is that some patients will get a dose higher than what they need, and suffer more side effects than necessary. With regard to half-life, if half of the standard dose remains in the body after 25 days, that amount may continue to be effective for some (if not many) patients. As an example, the half-life of the standard 150 mg daily dose of Tarceva is 36.2 hours. At that point, 75 mg remains in the body, from the previous day’s dose but another 150 mg dose has been added. Yet some patients who have difficulty tolerating that dose do quite well on as little as 25 mg/day. With that dose, at any given time there is much less than 75 mg of the drug in their body, yet it’s still effective. Your partner may want to discuss the possibility of either a dose reduction or an increase in the interval between treatments to, for example, 21 days. That might be an effective dose with fewer side effects. JimC Forum moderator",tarceva
"I have 3A NSCLC adenocarcinoma. I had surgery in February, top lobe removed and 13 lymph nodes- 4 were cancerous. I was told I was ""cancer free"".

My dentist found rampant bacteria and cavaties. He has been treating me for 20 years with regular checkups. He was dismayed by this aggressive bacteria. Today, I had two hours of work done....root canal on one tooth, crown off and bacteria cleaned on another tooth, cavity filled on another tooth. In two days, he may be working on three more teeth.

"AbbVie’s JAK1 inhibitor upadacitinib has proved more effective than the company’s widely-used TNF blocker Humira in a phase III trial in rheumatoid arthritis patients, without adding to a tally of thrombotic side effects. Upadacitinib met all the primary and secondary endpoints in the SELECT-COMPARE study - outperforming both placebo and Humira (adalimumab) on a range of clinical measures including the proportion of patients going into clinical remission, with 29% of those on AbbVie’s drug achieving that level of response compared to 18% with Humira and 6% of the placebo group. A 20% or more improvement in symptoms (ACR20) was seen in 71% of the upadacitinib group, versus 63% for Humira and 36% for placebo, which just achieved statistical significance, but AbbVie’s drug fared much better compared to its active comparator on the tougher ACR50 and ACR70 measures. The results were achieved in patients with moderate-to-severe RA who were being treated with methotrexate but whose symptoms were not being controlled. Crucially for AbbvVie, there were no cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the 1,629-patent study, something that was observed in two earlier phase III studies of the drug (SELECT-MONOTHERAPY and SELECT-BEYOND) and had claimed patient lives. Analysts said the lack of VTEs in the latest study reduced the risk in the upadacitinib programme and raises the drug’s chances of regulatory approval. The drug is vying to become the third drug in the class after Pfizer’s Xeljanz (tofacitinib) and Eli Lilly’s Olumiant (baricitinib), which was turned down by the FDA at first filing because thrombosis cases raised safety concerns. Lilly’s drug was approved in Europe, however, and has been refiled in the US with a verdict due later this year. Upadacitinib (also known as ABT-494) has been tipped by some analysts as a future leader of the category with sales of up to $3.5bn, with some suggesting it could even climb as high as $5bn at peak if it also shows its worth in follow-up indications like psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis. It’s one of three new drugs AbbVie had earmarked to help offset the decline in Humira sales that will follow the loss of patent protection, which will occur later this year in Europe but not until 2023 in the US. Humira is also being challenged by a number of newer drugs but thanks to price increases is still on a growth path. One of those new hopefuls - Rova-T for lung cancer - failed in trials but upadacitinib and anti-IL-23 antibody risankizumab (ABBV-066) remain on track after the latter reported positive phase III results in psoriasis in February.",upadacitinib
"Thank you all for your kind responses, A little update on my situation: I was admitted yesterday in the hospital for a „check up“, but on the MRI they found new lesions and even a few active ones (still not a surprise since my knees have been numb for 2 weeks now). And now I am staying in for 5 days for treatment. I am stopping Gilenya and switching to something else (still not sure what). Now I made the sudden decision to drop out of Uni and focus on my health. After all, I don’t want to graduate in a wheel chair. To be honest I am a little disappointed since I have been following the diet as if it was the Bible and yet doctors told me I am not even slightly better than three months ago.

Tagrisso was really good for him. I'd like to tell you that during his hospital admission he had some heart issues. Doctors say this may be caused by Tagrisso. My father hasn't done heart exams after starting with Tagrisso. I don't know if the exams could have made him live more. Maybe would be good if you talk to a cardiologist. I'm sending you positive vibes, I hope your mom continues without pain. I think she will have many years of hapiness, as my father did. And you will have a lot of time to tell her how much you love her. Please contact me whenever you want. Best wishes! Lms",tarceva
Thank you Brad! Wow! you have been on Gilenya a long time! I'm glad to hear that you haven't had any problems. I hope that the the pump helped with your spasticity.,gilenya
"Hello all, I am new here and came across this place looking for advice on my new treatment. I was diagnosed in 2010 with RRMS. I have been doing ok on Rebif all this time but recently had a MRI and have an active lesion. I have also suffered from dizzy spells, weakness in left hand and worst of all terrible fatigue, memory loss and difficulty with concentration. Its got to the point where people at work who dont know I have MS are saying I look like someone has taken out my battery. I try hard not to let people notice but its getting harder. I have also had a few other random symptoms but find it hard to say if its normal or the MS causing it. Anyway I went to the hospital today to have my meds looked at due to the MRI results. The advice from the neurolagist was to go on Mavenclad or Gilenya. I have read everything I could find on both and also looked both up on here but I am not sure which to choose. I like the idea that Maveclad is a 2 year treatment over a total of 5 days each year. I know I will still need to be monitored but it just seems ideal. Something they said bothers me which is why I am not sure. They said Gilenya is tablets daily but it means if I stop the effect just wears off but Mavenclad is not reversable. Not sure this is a problem but just seems so final. Also they say no treatment is needed in year 3 & 4. What happens after that in year 5….. Nothing is mentioned anywhere if you just do the course again or are they expecting the MS to stay in remission? I think these are things I need to email my MS nurse about. She did say what they would yreat me wirh if the Mevenclad would not work where as with Gilenya there are a couple of alternatives. The side effects of th Gilenya seem a but worse too which is why I am drawn to the Mavenclad. Just really hard making this decision. I know none of you can tell me what to choose but it helps knowing there might be others in my shoes and at least you all understand what Im dealing with. Thanks for reading my post would appriciat any advice if any of you have been in a similar situation. Also if anyone has had the Mavenclad treatment. I know some of you were about to start but not seen a post from anyone who has started. Thanks",mavenclad
"you can, but the risk is small so its really about how much of a small risk you are willing to take.Personally, I'd rather take that risk over relapse over relapse. Been on Gilenya over 2 years, no problems and one flare up of old symptoms and thats it. but of course your mileage may very",gilenya

"ALT-803 is composed of an IL-15 receptor fusion protein and a mutant form of IL-15. 1,2 It targets the shared IL-2 and IL-15 pathway, activating immune cells and nivolumab prevents tumor cells from evading them. “The combination of these two different effects might work synergistically to eliminate cancer cells,” noted Dr Rolfo and Dr Smits. 1 Significant and invariable toxicity hampered the use of IL-2 cytokine immunotherapy at therapeutic doses. 1,2 But authors of the new study reported that subcutaneously-injected 20 μg ALT-803 per kg once weekly (on weeks 1-5 of four 6-week cycles for 6 months) is safe and did not drive up nivolumab-associated adverse event rates. 2 The authors reported no dose-limiting toxicities for ALT-803 plus nivolumab and did not identify a maximum tolerated dose. 2 In a post-hoc analysis, 29% of study participants experienced a partial response, suggesting that “we can reassert control” in relapsed and ICI-refractory lung cancer, noted lead study author John M. Wrangle, MD, of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, and his coauthors. 2 “What's unique about our trial is that it's two completely different types of drugs that have never been combined in humans before, and the trial demonstrated that these drugs can be safely administered,” said senior study author Mark P. Rubinstein, PhD, of the Medical University of South Carolina, in a press release. 5  Related Articles Timely Reporting of Palliative Care Needs Leads to More Appropriate End-of-Life Care in NSCLC Osimertinib Improves Quality-of-Life and Global Health Status in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The post-hoc analysis suggests that ALT-803 might salvage ICI in refractory NSCLC, Dr Rubinstein suggested. No dual-immunotherapies or non-PD1/PD-L1 ICIs are yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for NSCLC. 2 More effective immunotherapy regimens that can bring clinical benefits to more patients with lung cancer and to “resurrect clinical benefit” after resistance emerges, represents a “huge unmet need,” they noted. 2 “The ability of ALT-803 to re-induce immunotherapeutic response in PD-1-relapsed and refractory NSCLC should stimulate a surge of renewed interest in cytokine combination treatments for cancer.” Injection-site reactions and flu-like symptoms were common (affecting 90% and 71% of patients, respectively). 2 Two patients experienced grade-3 toxicity (lymphocytopenia and fatigue) and another patient experienced a grade 3 heart attack. No grade 4 toxicities or patient deaths were reported. The study was funded by Altor BioScience, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center. Phase 2 trial enrollment is “ongoing,” the study authors reported. 2 There is reason for caution. As Dr Rolfo and Dr Smits point out, osimertinib and durvalumab showed similar early promise, only to later demonstrate troubling rates of adverse events. But even they express optimism. The study has “laid the foundation for further clinical investigation of the use of IL-15 agonists combined with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors as immunotherapy-based treatments to improve outcomes of patients with NSCLC and other tumors,” they wrote. 2 “Combination treatments are the future of immunotherapy.” References",osimertinib

"I am sorry but I need a little more room. I have not read the posting rules due to a lack of time right now. So I will apologize if its against site rules to post in two consecutive boxes. I am very fearful for one of the first times in my life.I lost my dad the day before my mother called to tell me she had lung cancer. I myself at the start of the post told you that I had stage 4 head and neck cancer (tonsil). According to most that I have read a reoccurrence of my cancer will most likely be the end of me within 6-8 months. The only thing that I have going against those numbers are the new meds that have been approved in the case of reoccurrence.Even with that by study values the new meds increase your life for a few months more than the old drugs did. The wonderful drugs that are Opdivo and Keyudra are not the miracles that television and the manufacturers would have you believe. I will add that I have been positive for 25 years too. I know what it is like to think you are going to die. I witnessed a miracle with the invention of protease inhibitors I was knocking on death’s door and all of a sudden I was getting better. Miracles do happen. I lost my sister about 3 years go she was the age that I am now which is 53. It was a massive heart attack in her sleep. So now that my sister and dad died mom is the only one left with me. If I lose her I am by myself in this world. I am married but I was thinking in ways of immediate family. It has been a horrible year to go along with many horrible years I had dealing with the HIV and AIDS. In addition, I almost died 5 times in total. Actually very close.However, at this time of my life, it is very difficult to deal with much more sadness. I do not want to lose my mother to although it will happen. She was supposed to live a longer life as I have grandparents who are 95 and 88. That was a bad assumption. If you at all have any thoughts on what I asked I would like the feedback. Thanks Seth",opdivo
"The development of ALK inhibitors for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rapidly progressing, yet acquired treatment resistance remains a key issue for a majority of patients. 1 ALK as a Target in NSCLC ALK gene fusions in NSCLC were first reported in 2007, and it was since determined that 3% to 7% of NSCLC tumors harbor an ALK rearrangement. These aberrations occur more frequently among younger patients with adenocarcinoma histology who never smoked or were low-level smokers. The EML4-ALK fusion is the most common, though all fusions contain the preserved ALK tyrosine kinase domain, an N-terminal promoter from the partner gene, and an N-terminal oligomerization domain of the partner, resulting in constitutive activation. ALK fusion proteins promote signaling pathways important for cell growth and survival. Four years since the discovery of ALK fusions in NSCLC, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. Second- and third-generation ALK inhibitors were since developed. First-generation ALK Inhibitors Crizotinib is a first-generation ALK inhibitor, which also targets MET and ROS1, that can result in impressive response rates compared with chemotherapy. In 2 phase 3 trials, crizotinib yielded an overall response rate (ORR) of 65% and 74% compared with 20% with pemetrexed or docetaxel ( P < .001), or 45% with pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin ( P < .001), respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was also significantly improved in both trials, at 7.7 months and 10.9 months with crizotinib compared with 3.0 months with pemetrexed or docetaxel ( P < .001) or 7.0 months with pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin ( P < .001). Overall survival (OS), however, was not significantly different with crizotinib compared with chemotherapy in either trial. This could be because of crossover after progression during chemotherapy, or due to acquired resistance. Crizotinib also lacks efficacy against central nervous system (CNS) metastases, and 20% of patients will develop CNS metastases during crizotinib treatment. Another issue is serious adverse events (AEs) not reported in initial trials, including erythema multiforme, acute interstitial lung disease, renal polycytosis, contact esophagitis, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and hypersensitivity. 2 A major challenge with crizotinib, as with all targeted therapies, is treatment resistance. Secondary resistance to crizotinib typically occurs within 1 year due to several known mechanisms. ALK gene amplifications or mutations within the kinase domain can occur, resulting in continued activity despite ALK inhibition. Activation of other components of the signaling pathways, such as EGFR, HSP90, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, can also overcome ALK inhibition by providing the tumor alternate oncogenic drivers. 2",pemetrexed

"@avengr13 I think I addressed an earlier post of yours….. maybe not. We have so much in common except I have spent the last 3 years reading everything available, applied for a clinical trial, fostered relationships with others in the clinical trial here in the States(FL). I just missed out on the last trial and have been fighting MS for decades even though just DX’d ’05 RRMS which is key to qualifying for Lem in the States. Depending on the insurance carrier, you either must be RRMS or a relapsing form of MS. Payers are becoming very biased against us “older” patients. They want us all to be deemed progressive so that they can decline their coverage of a DMD. I don’t think Tysabri should be in the same discussion as Lem. I have taken both drugs. Lem only required 8 infusions in the first 12 months for most participants in the 5 year clinical trial. It “resets” the immune system the first 30 days so MS traits are “unlearned”. Tysabri suppresses the immune system, no reset, and carries the risk of PML. Lem HALTED or REVERSED the progression of MS for most participants in the trial with NO risk of PML. Tysabri requires continuous monthly infusions forever.that can slow the progression of MS. SEs are serious for each drug; however, the most common ones with Lem are Thyroid related which are easily detected and managed using monthly blood tests (paid for in full by Genzyme), and common RX drugs. Lem research is being done right now using APPROVED drugs to take AFTER Lem to diminish the chance for SEs. Ocrelizumab is still YEARS away from approval. My best friend was WC bound with most of the horrible disabilities I am fighting. By tht third year post Lem, she was walking 4 miles/day and felt very well. She has had 5 rounds of infusions and setbacks, but has still benefitted greatly! This is just a short “cheat sheet” off the top of my head. I think it hits the major points that you should talk over with your neuro, or better yet find someone that is up to speed on current best MS therapies. She should be telling you, not me, and not you having to tell her! Think about! I wish you the best no matter what you decide!",ocrelizumab

Later my subcutaneous lesion started shrinking before avastin was added to my treatment. So there are tiny holes in theory, that I didnt respond to immunotherapy at all. But unfortunately most likely explanation still is, that immunotherapy isnt working after 6 moths and all I can do is buy time with differnt tki.

 dianaHi Diana,
 I see you started this thread last year. I also see that the cancer has spread. You could say that that is a most unfortunate development.
 I cannot help you except to tell you that a close friend of mine spent the last week attending to his mother who has been diagnosed with a recurrence of lung cancer after a 10 year remission, if that is even the right term.
 This is an interesting case because my friend is both a pastor of 40 years and a Hospice Chaplin for the last 10. His mother has rebuffed all talk about GOD and the afterlife for all the years he has been in the ministry. Her mantra has been “Denial has worked well for me this far, so why change.”
 You can imagine the consternation this has caused Gary, my friend. Now she is scared, and feels that it is too late.
 The point is, she may beat this again, just as you may, since you are fighting the same beast.
 We are told very clearly not to fear. Fat chance of that, most would say. But it is true and it is true because of this statement which is just as true.
 “To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord….. which is far better.”
 Gary recently shared with a group of us the “7 things we should all like to know before we die”. He complied this commentary from his 10 years as a Hospice Chaplin. It includes an outline as well as 2 ½ hours of personal stories and heartfelt explanations on each point.
 If you feel you might enjoy this, please feel free to private message your address information and I will forward a copy of both tomorrow when I get to the office.
 I pray GOD’s continued blessings on you even when it feels hard to feel blessed.

"The reason I put up this small table is because these antibody types turned out to be very important. For those who wants to know more here is the explanation. When an antibody binds to a cell it marks it for destruction by macrophages. That's how my lymphoma drug rituximab works. It binds to its target on my B cells and that kills all B cells. Some of the cancerous, some are not. Then the bone marrow makes new B cells. I was always wondering why macrophages don't kill T cells marked by checkpoint PD-1 antibodies. Turns out the type IgG4 (Opdivo, Keytruda) is not attractive to macrophages (very slight attraction). The strongest attraction of macrophages is to AgG1 type of antibodies. So, if a checkpoint inhibitor is type IgG1 there will be serious side effects as macrophages will recognize this type as a mark to kill the cell. As some of these checkpoints can be expressed on normal cells there are side effects. If you look at the pd-l1 antibodies only Avelumab belongs to type IgG1. That puts a target on all cells that express pd-l1 including normal cells. Macrophages would destroy all marked cells. The other three antibodies are better designed. Tecentriq and Durvalumab have a modified (engineered) IgG1 type that does not attract macrophages and BMS-936559 has the type IgG4 as in the case of Opdivo and Keytruda (not attractive to macrophages). The purpose of the checkpoint antibodies is not to kill any cell, but to prevent the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1. That will activate another mechanism in which activated T cells kill abnormal cancer cells.",opdivo
"In 1996, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ® (NCCN ® ) published its first set of Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines ® ) covering 8 tumor types. Guidelines are now published for more than 60 tumor types and topics. Some of the key updates were presented at NCCN’s 23rd Annual Conference and are briefly summarized here. Rectal Cancer “There is a great deal interest now in giving all total neoadjuvant therapy, ie, chemotherapy, then chemoradiation, then surgery or chemoradiation, then chemotherapy, then surgery. Either is now recommended in the guidelines.” —Christopher Willett, MD   Christopher Willett, MD A number of important changes were made to the NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer, as presented by Christopher Willett, MD , of Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina: There is greater acceptance of an observational approach, ie, “watch and wait, nonoperative management,” for select patients achieving a complete clinical response and no evidence of residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. The guidelines are now more closely aligned with the Guidelines for Colon Cancer. A new definition of the rectum is based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging, delineating the area below a virtual line from the sacral promontory to the upper end of the symphysis. The use of MRI in staging has been elevated in importance. There is a new emphasis on neoadjuvant therapy, building on the concurrent use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy with additional chemotherapy. Colon Cancer “With data from the IDEA trial, we now have a platform for a framework to discuss these data with patients, and that’s the strength of IDEA.” —Axel Grothey, MD   Axel Grothey, MD Axel Grothey, MD , of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Phoenix, and Alan Venook, MD , of the University of California, San Francisco, described revisions to the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer: Data from the pivotal IDEA trial, which evaluated 3 vs 6 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, have been incorporated into the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer. The guidelines recommend that for low-risk stage III patients, the preferred regimen is CAPEOX (capecitabine/oxaliplatin) for 3 months or FOLFOX (leucovorin/fluorouracil/oxaliplatin) for 3 to 6 months (category 1 for 6 months). For high-risk stage III patients (T4/N1–2, or any T and N2), the preferred regimen is CAPEOX for 3 to 6 months (category 1 for 6 months) or FOLFOX for 6 months (category 1). In metastatic disease, tumor sidedness should be a consideration in choosing a biologic. For  BRAF -mutated advanced disease, options include several triplets. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are approved as a subsequent line of therapy in patients with advanced disease whose tumors are found to be microsatellite instability–high (MSI-high) or are mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors if determined by gene sequencing. Breast Cancer “If you reflect what’s gone on over the past couple of years, it’s really been the era of the CDK4/6 inhibitors…. Reflected in the guidelines are a number of different options among the three CDK4/6 inhibitors, with a category 1 level of evidence.” —William J. Gradishar, MD   William J. Gradishar, MD Several speakers updated attendees on breast cancer management, including William J. Gradishar, MD , of Northwestern University, Chicago; Sharon H. Giordano, MD, MPH , of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston; and Anthony D. Elias, MD , of the University of Colorado Cancer Center, Denver. These updates for patients with HER2-positive or hormone receptor–positive disease were presented: For HER2-positive patients, there are two new adjuvant treatment options: pertuzumab (Perjeta; given with trastuzumab [Herceptin] and chemotherapy) and neratinib (Nerlynx; for use as extended hormonal treatment following trastuzumab in high-risk patients). For those with advanced hormone receptor–positive disease, treatment options now include three inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), both for postmenopausal and premenopausal patients. The guidelines reiterated that women who are postmenopausal at diagnosis may consider extending endocrine therapy for an additional 5 years, although the benefits and risks must be weighed. Breast cancer staging was updated to reflect changes in the  American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual (8th Edition, 2017). Treatment recommendations were ranked according to “preferred,” “other,” and “useful in certain circumstances.” Screening and Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma “When we screen for hepatocellular carcinoma, we are finding disease at a stage that is amenable to potentially curative treatment and, associated with that, improvements in survival at 1, 3, and 5 years.” —Anne M. Covey, MD   Anne M. Covey, MD Anne M. Covey, MD , of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, described the updates to the guidelines for screening and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: Patients deemed at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (ie, those with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B infection) should undergo ultrasound with or without assessment of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a primary screening tool (with certain exceptions). Patients with a negative ultrasound should continue surveillance with ultrasound with or without AFP every 6 months. Follow up with ultrasound with or without AFP in 3 to 6 months is recommended if a lesion < 10 mm is identified. For those with a positive AFP level or a nodule ≥ 10 mm, capsular retraction or vascular invasion on ultrasound, further workup with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required. Lung Cancer “There is a growing list of approved targets and therapies included in the 2018 NCCN Guidelines [for Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer] as well as emerging targets. Why does this matter? Because targeted therapies improve survival.” —Karen L. Reckamp, MD, MS   Karen L. Reckamp, MD, MS The 2018 NCCN Guidelines Updates for Targeted Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) recommend molecular testing for first initial diagnosis, since targeted therapies that can improve outcomes for many patients are available, explained Karen L. Reckamp, MD, MS , of City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California. Approved therapies are available for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and BRAF mutations. The list of emerging “actionable” targets is growing. The 2018 NCCN Guidelines incorporate new therapies, including the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib (Tagrisso) and the ALK inhibitor alectinib (Alecensa), as first-line preferences. Kidney Cancer “It is a very exciting time in renal cell carcinoma, with new treatments. Most new treatments are for clear cell carcinoma.” —Eric Jonasch, MD   Eric Jonasch, MD There were several updates to the 2018 NCCN Guidelines for Kidney Cancer, noted Eric Jonasch, MD , of the Von Hippel-Landau Clinical Center at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Adjuvant sunitinib (Sutent) is the first adjuvant therapy to be endorsed by the 2018 NCCN Guidelines for patients with stage II and III high-risk renal cell carcinoma and clear cell histology (category 2 B). Two new options are included for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma: The combination of ipilimumab plus nivolumab for poor- and intermediate-risk patients. Cabozantinib (Cabometyx) was added as a first-line option for poor- and intermediate-risk patients with relapsed renal cell carcinoma or stage IV unresectable advanced renal cell carcinoma. Prostate Cancer “If you do it properly [ie, intermittent androgen-deprivation therapy, (ADT)], there is a significant quality-of-life benefit. We can be more intelligent and personalize ADT.” —James L. Mohler, MD, and Peter R. Carroll, MD   Peter R. Carroll, MD  James L. Mohler, MD The 2018 NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines recommend baseline screening beginning at age 45, which is younger than in the other sets of guidelines, explained Peter R. Carroll, MD , of the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. Risk stratification and proper staging workup are emphasized more strongly in the 2018 iteration of the NCCN Guidelines than in the past, explained James L. Mohler, MD , of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York. The 2018 NCCN guidelines provide alternatives to routine biopsy in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, including the use of serum and urine biomarkers and multiparametric MRI before moving to biopsy. Active surveillance is advised for very low–risk and low-risk patients. Molecular testing and germline testing are recommended early in the course of disease for patients with a strong family history (defined for the first time in the new guidelines), with the aim of developing more personalized medicine. Germline testing is advised for more advanced disease. Testing for germline and/or somatic mutations should be considered in all men with high-risk, very high–risk, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer. Men with BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM , PALB2 , and FANCA should be referred for genetic counseling and early use of platinum chemotherapy or enrollment in a clinical trial. Men with MSI and deficient MMR should be referred for genetic counseling and are eligible for pembrolizumab when they fail to respond to ADT. According to the 2018 NCCN Guidelines, patients with asymptomatic castration-naive metastatic prostate cancer should receive intermittent ADT; they should be made aware of a possible small trade-off in overall survival for improved quality of life during the off cycle. For symptomatic men, continuous ADT should be considered, but if the PSA level decreases to < 4 ng/mL and certainly < 0.2 ng/mL, intermittent ADT is reasonable. Younger healthier men should consider docetaxel or abiraterone (Zytiga) added to ADT, whereas older and/or unhealthier men should receive ADT. Apalutamide (Erleada) is now one of the recommended second-generation antiandrogens incorporated in the 2018 NCCN Guidelines. The updated guidelines distinguish between management of patients with visceral metastasis versus skeletal metastasis. Gliomas: Molecular Pathology in Staging and Treatment of Anaplastic Gliomas “These three markers [co-deletion of 1p and 19q, IDH 1 and IDH 2 mutations, and MGMT promoter methylation] are currently the most important clinical markers in managing malignant gliomas.” —Matthias Holdhoff, MD, PhD The 2018 NCCN Guidelines incorporate molecular characteristics and pathologic characteristics in the staging and treatment of anaplastic gliomas. Testing for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and co-deletion of 1p and 19q is now a key element in the diagnostic workup of gliomas based on the recently published World Health Organization classification on brain tumors of 2016.   Matthias Holdhoff, MD, PhD The highest level of evidence for the treatment of newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendrogliomas with co-deletion of 1p and 19q has the regimen of radiation and chemotherapy with PCV (procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine). An ongoing prospective trial in these cancers, the so-called CODEL trial, is formally comparing this regimen with the somewhat better tolerated regimen of radiation and temozolomide (which is the current standard regimen for glioblastomas), explained Matthias Holdhoff, MD, PhD , of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore. Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Emphasis on Genetics “It is becoming increasingly important to become aware not only of a particular mutation but of the spectrum of mutations that occurs in a given patient [with acute myeloid leukemia]. They have important interactions that lead to dramatic differences in overall survival.” —Martin S. Tallman, MD   Martin S. Tallman, MD The diagnosis, staging, and treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have evolved based on the identification of important genetic alterations and drugs to target those genes. Cytogenetic abnormalities are the main concern in managing AML, explained Martin S. Tallman, MD , of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. Among important genetic aberrations are CEBP-alpha , FLT3 , IDH1 , IDH2 , P53 , and NPM1 . The company these genetic abnormalities keep—ie, their combinations—affects prognosis. Four drug approvals of novel agents have improved outcomes in patients with AML: midostaurin (Rydapt; targeted to FLT3 ), gemtuzumab (for CD33-positive AML), CPX-351 (a 5:1 formulation of daunorubicin/cytarabine for treatment-naive patients), and isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) inhibitors enasidenib and ivosidenib (for relapsed or refractory patients with IDH mutations). Achieving minimal residual disease is recognized as an increasingly important milestone. ■ DISCLOSURE: For full disclosures of all speakers, visit https://www.nccn.org/disclosures/guidelinepanellisting.aspx .",tagrisso
"The investigational anti-α4β7 integrin antibody abrilumab in different doses significantly improved 8-week remission rates versus placebo in refractory patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC), a phase IIb trial found. Significant improvements were also observed in clinical response and mucosal healing at week 8, according to the international team of researchers. ""Our data further support the mechanism of targeting the anti-α4β7 pathway as a therapeutic option for the management of moderate to severe UC and the use of anti-α4β7 levels as a potential prognostic indicator in UC,"" wrote William J. Sandborn, MD, of the University of California San Diego, and colleagues. As they explained in their study online in Gastroenterology , the influx of immune cells into gut mucosa, mediated through integrin-dependent leukocytes, plays an important role in IBD pathogenesis. The cellular adhesion molecule α4β7 integrin mediates stable adhesion to high endothelial venules and promotes lymphocyte migration across the endothelial wall. The team noted that restricting homing of lymphocytes to the gastrointestinal tract by blocking essential integrin-mediated interactions has been an area of intensive clinical research over the past 2 decades, and targeting gut-selective lymphocyte trafficking is a promising therapeutic strategy in IBD. Study Details During 2012-2015, Sandborn and co-authors recruited 359 patients with a mean age of 40 from 92 centers in North America, Europe, and Australia. Patients had a total Mayo Score of 6-12 and a rectosigmoidoscopy score of ≥2 with inadequate response or intolerance to immunosuppressives, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, and/or corticosteroids. Participants were randomized to receive subcutaneous abrilumab (7, 21, or 70 mg) on day 1, weeks 2 and 4, and every 4 weeks; abrilumab 210 mg on day 1; or placebo. Demographic and disease characteristics were similar across the three groups. The primary endpoint was remission (total Mayo Score ≤2 points, no individual subscore >1 point) for the two highest dosages at week 8. Key secondary endpoints were response and mucosal healing at week 8. After the initial double-blind phase, treatment continued through 24 weeks. Following randomization, a total of 354 patients were included in the 8-week double-blind phase. Of these, 238 patients received ≥1 dose of the investigational drug and 116 received placebo. By week 8, 332 patients had completed the initial phase. The non-adjusted remission rates were 4.3% for the placebo group and 13.3% and 12.7%, for the abrilumab 70-mg and 210-mg groups, respectively ( P <0.05 for both doses versus placebo). That translated into an odds ratio (OR) of achieving remission with abrilumab 70 mg of 3.35 (90% CI 1.41-7.95, P =0.021) and with 210 mg of 3.33 (90% CI1.34- 8.26, P =0.030). The authors noted, however, that these rates were lower than the 21% anticipated in the sample size calculation. The 8-week clinical response and mucosal healing rates at the two higher doses were also significantly greater versus placebo, with ORs of 2.78 at 70 mg and 2.57 at 210 mg. The odds of mucosal healing were also higher: ORs of 2.34 and 2.10, respectively. Adverse event rates were comparable across groups through treatment week 24, with 68% of placebo recipients and 63% of abrilumab recipients reporting at least one treatment-emergent adverse event of any grade. The safety profile is comparable to that of vedolizumab (Entyvio), the authors noted. Higher baseline concentrations of the antibody were a favorable prognostic indicator in UC disease activity and Mayo Score response, but not a predictive biomarker of abrilumab response. No cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or deaths occurred. The researchers cited several limitations to the study, including a systematic misalignment of treatments that led some patients randomized to the abrilumab 7-mg group to erroneously receive 70 mg, and some randomized to the 21-mg group to erroneously receive placebo. These patients were analyzed based on the actual treatment received with no impairment of blinding and minimal change to the study's power of detection, Sandborn and co-authors noted. Additionally, they said, because the study was short term, it did not fully evaluate continued treatment following induction of remission at 8 weeks. ""Although we observed a trend toward treatment effect at week 24 for the 70-mg multi-dose group, longer-term phase III studies evaluating clinical remission and response rates beyond 24 weeks are required to draw conclusions on the durability of treatment response,"" the researchers wrote. ""Finally, conclusions regarding treatment responses based on previous TNF antagonist treatment are limited, but initial findings suggested potential benefit in both naive and exposed patients.""",entyvio
"My mom was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at age 43 in October 2015. Around that time I was 23, just graduated college and passed my CPA exams. I moved to NYC to start my career in public accounting. My mom's case was severe, she was a single parent without health insurance and always put her kids first (I am the oldest of 3, with two brothers who are now 21 and 9). As a result, by the time she sought treatment and was diagnosed, her colon was so far gone that we didn't have a shot with humira or remicade. By November 2015 the pain was so severe my mom's body could no longer handle the strain of working in the food industry and she had to quit. In February 2016 she started the first of her three surgeries for the end result being a proctocectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. She conquered her final procedure in December 2016 and we thought we were in the clear...finally the road to recovery! Unfortunately we were wrong. In addition to the extreme emotional and mental changes I have seen in her, she has had severe complications with her eyes and lungs that came to fruition relatively quickly post operation. Her cough is so severe that she has fractured her ribs twice now. It's sad and scary that at age 45 she can't walk more than a block without being out of breath. To all of this the doctors have been unable to definitively conclude on a treatment and simply attribute it to her ""UC and auto immune disease"". To make matters worse my mom is a financial mess. She was granted disability in April 2017, but before that went without pay since November 2015. Her current situation is not sustainable to cover her rent and provide for my 9 year old brother, etc. I feel like I'm at a dead end. I travel home from NYC as often as I can and financially provide as much as a 25 year old's salary can, but it's not enough. Caregivers, how do you stay in the loop on your loved ones treatments/care/doctor visits etc if you are unable to be there live? Does anyone have a loved one experiencing similar complications to my mom? If so, what is their medical routine? My mom sees a therapist, rheumatologist, ophthalmologist, PCP... I just feel like we are 8 months post surgery and have made progress in some ways, and 10 steps back in others. Does anyone have any financial resources for the disabled or struggling IBD patients? Should I just move back home? Will I ever get my mom back?",humira

"Tashia, In responding to a post, you can quote the specific post you are interested in. But, in your case, a good way to use your site is to post in the Introduce Yourself section of our forum. On the upper right side of the introductory page, you should see a Start new topic box. Checking that and posting allows everyone to see your story and realize you are new. From your description of your uncle's treatment, it sounds like he is receiving first-line standard of care treatment for inoperable Stage IV lung cancer. He is receiving combination chemotherapy -- conventional chemo paired with Keytruda, a very effective immunotherapy drug. As Steff reported on her mother's immunotherapy treatment, this combination can be very effective. So others here can provide first hand information, you might tell us about the type of lung cancer your uncle has. You have 3 questions: will this treatment improve his quality of life; will it prolong his life; and will it cure or stop his cancer? Life quality in treatment depends on a lot of factors: age, general health condition, complicating serious illness, and many more. If his first line treatment works, his life quality will improve. You've already reported some improvement in his breathing. Will treatment prolong life? That is the goal and for very many, prolonged life is achieved. In my case, treatment has allowed me to live almost 15 years beyond diagnosis. Can the treatment cure? We don't use the cure word in the lung cancer community but rather use the term no evidence of disease or NED. Yes, this treatment can allow your uncle to achieve NED. It is not unusual for other nodules to occur while receiving immunotherapy treatment. It takes time for the immune system to be primed to recognize cancer cells and during early treatment, scans often show tumor growth or new metastasis. How long is your uncle's treatment period? What are the other drugs he is receiving besides Keytruda? Welcome here. We hope your uncle's treatment resolves his lung cancer. Stay the course. Tom Tom My Uncle is on a 3 month treatment period. He is at his 2nd month point. I believe they are to do another scan this coming Friday. He is having two types of Chemo and Keytruda, that is only drugs they are giving him.

"Now with more current data, the concept of pseudoprogression is a concern for many oncologists from the other side of the equation - waiting too long for immuno to work can be a mistake. Here's a recent article by Dr. Jack West of Cancer Grace. Different cancers have different pseudoprogression rates. In melanoma, it can be fairly significant. In lung cancer, it's between 1 and 3 percent. http://cancergrace.org/lung/2016/09/12/death-by-pseudoprogression-knowing-w hen-to-cut-your-losses-with-immunotherapy/#more-17624 Along the same thinking, here's a quote from a lung cancer presentation by Dr. Eddie Garon, in which he says, ""One other important issue to address is this issue of pseudoprogression, and this is something that people in the immunotherapy field have talked about for a long time, that if you have an effective immunotherapy, that you may have immune cells that infiltrate into the tumor and, as a result, rather than getting smaller, that the tumor would actually get larger. That could certainly happen over a short period of time, but what I would say, to date, is it’s not something we’ve seen a lot in lung cancer. Our colleagues in melanoma certainly report this as being a significant issue — patients who will have initial growth of their tumor on imaging, and then, afterwards, will have shrinking. We certainly do have several intriguing anecdotes, sort of individual patients that people will describe who have had, sort of, increases in their tumor volume, but then get better, but I would say that it is actually quite uncommon in lung cancer. So, the dilemma continues to be do we roll the dice if there's some progression and continue for a while, or move onto the next line of treatment? In my case, the first scan after two rounds of Keytruda, showed ""mixed"" results (some progression, some shrinkage, some hint of perhaps new things). Since my PD-1 expression is so high (90%) and because my performance status continues to be zero, oncologist and I decided to keep going for another three infusions and then rescan. He said, ""Conventional wisdom would tell us to move on to something else."" So, we're bucking conventional wisdom for now , with full understanding that it's a risk. Next scan will be in two weeks (after five infusions, total). Clem",keytruda

"This is an oral medication in capsule form.  Description Gilenya® is a new class of medication called a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, which is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells (lymphocytes) in the lymph nodes, thereby preventing those cells from crossing the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system (CNS). Preventing the entry of these cells into the CNS reduces inflammatory damage to nerve cells. Gilenya was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 for adults with relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the accumulation of physical disability.

Whether it was a good or bad move is moot at this point, I'm afraid. Note that I'm still on Imuran and the doc doesn't plan to take me off that--just to add steroids to manage the flare.

"Hi Dutch46, I hope someone who has used nivolumab in this context can chime in, because I don’t have an good data to share with you on its efficacy in mBAC, but Dr. Evan Lipson of Johns Hopkins presented some good information on managing immunotherapy side effects in this podcast. I checked out the PD-L1 Blueprint Project assay comparison paper; thanks for pointing out that interesting study. It illuminates the issue of just how slippery the distinction between high and low PD-L1 expression can be, as well as the still-open question of how well does the level of expression predict response to treatment. Different trials use varying cutoffs between high and low, and as the report states, the experience of the pathologist with a particular assay can be a factor. It’s certainly doubtful that a patient just above the chosen threshold will fare significantly better than one just below it. Although it may not provide much comfort to you and your wife, who were hoping to get the trial drug, in almost two-thirds of the small number of cases there was agreement between all four assays, and by one practical standard, the assay chosen might only have affected inclusion in about 15% of the cases.

I was diagnosed after my j-pouch surgery. Who know whether I had PSC first then UC, it doesn't matter to me because it doesn't change the diagnosis. The initial diagnosis scared me only because I had a baby (yes after J-pouch surgery) and I was afraid I wouldn't be here to watch her grow. Now, I know a lot more about PSC. Yes it has to be monitored and yes I might someday need a liver transplant, but what good does that do me to worry about that today? The worst problem I have with it today is itching but it can be managed. I agree with iPoop it is good to have an understanding of your medical issues, but you can make yourself crazy doing so.

"Cancer immunotherapy is going from strength to strength, as first and second generation therapies that alert the immune system to hidden tumours by switching off checkpoint controls continue to have spectacular success in the clinic. Inevitably there have been setbacks, as many patients do not respond, or cannot tolerate the often toxic side effects of treatment, but a future where immunotherapy replaces chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for many cancers seems likely. While there is still intense interest in further refining existing therapies targeting checkpoint controls, attention in both the academic and pharmaceutical sectors has also turned to the next big challenge: the problem of why some patients and tumour types are non-responders. The solution, according to many, lies in combination therapy – using both old and new ways of manipulating the anti-tumour immune response in concert with relief of checkpoint controls. Protocols combining immunotherapy with radio- and virotherapy are also being developed globally. The advent of immunotherapy is truly a step-change in our ability to treat many cancers. As the excitement settles into a consideration of how best to move forward, it has never been more important to support and develop the immunotherapy community within the UK. Of course, as in any field, scientists will always be the key to progress, but funding organisations also have an important part to play. CRUK has the resources and ambition to turn your ideas into patient benefit as quickly and efficiently as possible, so come and talk to us – we can help you to help us step into a new era of cancer therapy.  The Cancer-Immunity Cycle Once jump-started by immunotherapy, successful tumour killing needs the anti-cancer immune response to become self-driven. Aiding this crucial transition, whilst preventing it from running out of control, is the rationale behind combination therapy. For clarity, it’s helpful to consider the anti-cancer immune response as a cycle, as proposed by Dan Chen and Ira Mellman in an influential Immunity review in 2013. The Cancer-Immunity Cycle begins when cancer cell antigens are released (step 1), and presented to the immune system (step 2), resulting in priming and activation of T cells (step 3). Activated T cells must then migrate to and infiltrate the tumour (steps 4 and 5), where they bind to tumour cells (step 6), and collaborate with the innate immune system to kill them (step 7). Cell killing leads to the release of more cancer antigens, resulting in another revolution of the cycle. Each successive revolution amplifies the response. Steps 3 and 7 are the points in the cycle at which checkpoint controls can kick in, putting the brakes on the cycle and stopping it dead. The recent immunotherapeutic breakthroughs have resulted from the development of agents able to take these brakes off. The anti-CTL4 drug ipilimumab forces T cell activation at step 3, and the anti-PD1/PDL1 drugs nivolumab and pembrolizumab maintain activated anti-tumour T cells in a combat-ready state at step 7, by inhibiting T cell exhaustion and tolerance. Taking the brakes off means that therapeutics able to accelerate and amplify the cycle are now able to work more effectively.   Step 1: Release of cancer cell antigens Many existing targeted drugs currently being trialled as combination therapies focus on cancer cell killing, with concomitant release of antigens, but other modalities are increasingly in the spotlight. At The Institute of Cancer Research, Kevin Harrington is running a Phase III trial of T-VEC, an HSV-1-based oncolytic virotherapy, in combination with pembrolizumab for treatment of advanced melanoma. And in a different approach, a Trojan Horse oncolytic therapy is being explored at the University of Sheffield: work from the labs of Claire Lewis and Munitta Mutana, showing that a patient’s own macrophages can transport the oncolytic virus Ad[I/PPT-E1A] deep into the heart of prostate tumours, is now being taken into a CRUK-funded Phase I clinical trial led by Janet Brown, also in Sheffield, and in collaboration with our Centre for Drug Development (CDD). Combined radio- and immunotherapy is attracting attention, due to the abscopal effect, a phenomenon whereby on rare occasions localised radiotherapy together with relief of checkpoint blockade is associated with the regression of metastatic cancer at a distance.  Step 2: Cancer antigen presentation Vaccination, the traditional way of artificially presenting antigens to the immune system, is experiencing a resurgence. Therapeutic cancer vaccines have a long and largely unsatisfactory history, which in the light of our new understanding of checkpoint inhibition is now perfectly explicable; trying to rev up an immune system whose brakes are firmly applied was never going to be successful. However, as a combination therapy, vaccines are far more likely to work, and CRUK has some exciting prospects in the pipeline. One of these is the work of Alan Rickinson and colleagues at the University of Birmingham, whose long-term commitment to EBV vaccine development was recognised by the 2015 CRUK Translational Cancer Research Prize. Dendritic cells are the professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system, and using them as vectors to stimulate an immune response to cancer has had some success in the past. However, the need to laboriously culture dendritic cells from individual patients, and then load the cells in vitro with cancer antigens, has severely limited progress. Our CDD has an innovative take on this. In partnership with Asterias Biotherapeutics, they’ve developed an off the shelf approach where stem cells can be differentiated into dendritic cells, which are then loaded with telomerase, commonly upregulated in many tumours. The resulting vaccine, AST-VAC2, is being made in the CRUK Biotherapeutics Development Unit at Clare Hall, and is projected to enter a clinical trial in lung cancer in 2017.  Step 3: Priming and activation Step 3 is the point of the cycle at which the effector: regulatory T cell balance of the immune response is established. CTLA4-blocking antibodies such as ipilimumab move the balance over to favour effector T cells, allowing a more vigorous immune response, but anti-CTL4 blockade is not always effective. Alternatives, such as agonistic antibodies able to switch on positive regulators of effector T cells, are being trialled in combination therapies, but whilst promising, it’s too early to say whether such strategies will be widely applicable due to sometimes severe toxicity.  Steps 4 & 5: Infiltration of T cells into tumours Analysis of cancers where checkpoint inhibitors have been ineffective has shown that in some cases, notably pancreatic cancer, tumours can construct a fortress around themselves that immune cells cannot penetrate. In 2014, Doug Fearon and colleagues at our CRUK Cambridge Institute showed that pancreatic tumour cells are coated in the T-cell-excluding CXCL12 chemokine; remarkably, whilst anti-PDL1 therapy was ineffective, combining it with the CXCL12 inhibitor AMD3100 resulted in significant tumour shrinkage in a mouse model. Two years on, AMD3100 is going into Phase I clinical trials for pancreatic cancer both here and in the US, with a view to testing it in combination therapies. Glasgow-based CRUK scientists Jennifer Morton and Owen Sansom, working in collaboration with AstraZeneca have recently shown that this approach can be extended to other chemokines. In their labs, an experimental drug against the CXCR2 protein not only suppressed metastasis in a mouse model, but, just as for AMD3100, improved T cell entry into pancreatic tumours. In mice, combined inhibition of CXCR2 and PD1 significantly extended survival, making CXCR2 another excellent prospect for a therapeutic target.  Step 6: Recognition of cancer cells by T cells CAR-T cells, so called because they express artificial Chimaeric Antigen Receptors, can bind to and kill cancer cells. Using CRISPR to modify and introduce genes into cells means that such cell-based therapies are booming. Engineered receptors of all shapes and sizes are being developed, aimed at achieving better activation and killing, whilst ramping up the affinity and specificity with which the receptors recognise and bind their tumour targets. To increase efficacy, most are being considered in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, as are the therapies described below. In another approach to tumour recognition, dual specificity antibodies and connecting bi-specific T cell engagers (BiTEs) are being used as bridging molecules to grab hold of tumour and immune cells, bringing them close enough to activate the kill function of the immune cells. Those that have been trialled so far are showing high response rates, albeit often with high toxicity. CRUK is supporting several lines of work in this area, ranging from trials of next generation CAR-T cells for neuroblastoma (John Anderson at Great Ormond Street Hospital, sponsored and managed by our CDD) and pancreatic cancer (John Maher at UCL) to a company based around CAR-T therapy to disrupt tumour vasculature via binding to CLEC14a, a marker of tumour angiogenesis (Steven Lee and Roy Bicknell in Birmingham, in collaboration with CRT and the Cell Therapy Catapult).  Step 7: Killing of cancer cells The interaction of cancer cells with the tumour microenvironment, including the cells of the adaptive and innate immune systems, determines whether a tumour will survive and prosper or wither away. Whilst targeting the PD1/PDL1 checkpoint has been very successful, it’s clear that combining checkpoint inhibition with other strategies to mould the inflammatory microenvironment will be even more effective. A host of ideas are currently touted, particularly in the relatively unexplored area of innate immunity. There’s a lot of interest in manipulating inflammasomes, the signalling scaffolds that trigger cell killing by the innate immune system. Agonists are being developed to artificially activate the inflammatory response, although concerns about toxicity mean that any such therapies would have to be strictly topical, perhaps delivered by injection into the tumour.  The CRUK-MEDI Alliance Laboratory: Crowdsourcing new ideas in antibody therapy Monoclonal antibody-based drugs have provided the platform for the success of immunotherapeutic checkpoint inhibition. The exquisite specificity of antibody variable regions as a means of manipulating the immune system and its tumour targets, means that the role of antibody-based biotherapeutics has never been more important. The CRUK-MEDI Alliance Laboratory is testament to CRUK’s determination to put biotherapeutics front and centre of our research. The lab, a joint project between CRUK and MedImmune, is an opportunity to crowdsource ideas for new targets, and rapidly put them into practice. According to Rob Williams, Chief Drug Development Scientist for our Centre for Drug Development (CDD): “The philosophy is that we don’t know what’s coming next”, he says, “so we want to tap into the community to pick up exciting ideas, and turn them into novel biological therapeutics”. The lab specialises in phage display technology, which allows researchers to quickly scan through millions of randomly-generated antibodies to find ones that recognise important molecules involved in cancer. Maria Groves believes MedImmune is the perfect partner for such a strategy. “MedImmune provide 20 years of phage display expertise and in-depth knowledge of the technology and drug discovery and disease processes”, she says. But collaboration will be the key: “Building a network of principal investigators generating novel ideas for oncology therapeutics will be central to the success of this exciting new venture”, Maria continues. The lab has already reviewed over 20 applications, several of which are now major active projects. Whilst access to the lab was initially open only to CRUK-funded researchers, in autumn 2016, this will be opened up to all researchers. Rob’s message to the research community is clear: “We want people to think imaginatively about novel ways of using biotherapeutics to fight cancer, and to come to us with those ideas. CRUK has the infrastructure and funding schemes to develop new concepts into tomorrow’s medicines – we want to hear from you!”  Find out how the CRUK-MEDI Alliance Laboratory can support your research In this article  Rob Williams Chief Drug Development Scientist, CRUK Centre for Drug Development   Maria Groves Head, CRUK-MEDI Alliance Laboratory  Discover more How we support drug discovery research CRUK Centre for Drug Development brochure (PDF)  This story is part of Pioneering Research: our annual research publication for 2015/16 .

"Hi. I'm diagnosed with Crohn's disease and was taking Remicade for about a year but started getting a skin reaction from it, so I went off the medicine. However I'm having such a flare right now and just recently got a colonoscopy done and wow my insides don't look good. I want to go back on remicade, but I hear people have bad results and it won't work for them after they stop taking it? I haven't been taking it for maybe 3 or 4 months now. Is there still a chance for me to get back on it? Can my body still accept it again and work for me? Has anyone here ever gotten back on remicade successfully?",remicade

You can't prove that you took x so you only had 3 relapses instead of 4. All you can say is you only had 3 relapses. When you end up in a wheelchair regardless, in the same timeframe, it doesn't matter how many shots you took. When you read the studies and see that the difference between CRAB and nothing is essentially the same, it's a pretty hard argument for me to make that there is a reason to take shots every day.

Either continue the drug at very high risk or go drug-free. Patient A started Ocrevus with very low PML risk. I believe as long as you are NEDA or having acceptable relapses, going mild drugs is better for the future. Wasting better drugs at early stages is not a good choice.",ocrevus
"Hi everyone, I am new to the forum and I am seeking help, if possible. My name is Laura, I have Relapsing Remitting MS and I am considering to move to Exeter from Germany. Since I am not familiar with the system in the UK, I was hoping someone could help me figure out how things are in terms of care and access to it. I was diagnosed with MS in September 2012 and have been on Gilenya ever since, with no relapses or major side effect. I was wondering if that's an established treatment in the UK and if anyone knows of any specialist in the area of Exeter who are familiar with it, since my neurologist strongly recommends that I don't switch medications. I am also concerned about the costs and the type of assistance I would be able to get within the NHS or some other private insurance, e.g. the cost of Gilenya itself, and of all the check-ups related to the medication and MS in general ( bi- or tri-monthly blood tests that are necessary with Gilenya, MRI scans, steroid treatments in case of a relapse, etc.) Can anyone tell me how straight-forward it is to obtain access to these services, using the infrastructure available in the Exeter area? Are there any specialists you can recommend? What would be the advantage, if any, to opt for a private insurance? Finally, there is the question of waiting times. Can anyone give me an indication of how long it would take me to get to see a specialist, and wether I can directly get in touch with them to schedule my first appointment? Do I need to register for NHS before-hand? I realize that these are quite a few and general questions, but already getting any information from people with first-hand experience with the system and the doctors in and around Exeter would be of great help. Thank you very much in advance to those who will take the time to reply to my questions :) Have a nice day, Laura",gilenya

"Hi Daxys, I'd be circumspect about interpreting clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors since your Mum has a uncommon variant and that variant is known to respond significantly better to second generation TKI therapies like Afatinib than to first or third generation, at least as first line treatment. This is different than Exon 19 and 21 mutations that respond best to Osimertinib (third generation) as first line. So I would not read too much into the studies that do not focus on your Mum's initial mutation. I would also wonder if the brain met (if that is what it is) only arose when your Mum was taken of off Afatinib. Without knowing the mutations she presently has it is hard to make any inferences. My inclination would be to try a rechallenge with Afatinib and see if that changes the rate of growth. If it slows things down at all. Afatinib also penetrates the blood brain barrier. It is noteworthy that your Mum's rate of progression changed once she was taken off of Afatinib. Barring using Afatinib either alone or in combination (as Jim suggested in his post) since you already have access to Osimertinib that might be the best course at this point that is available to you.",osimertinib

I had my second infusion of Entyvio on September 12 and will have my third on October 10th. The First infusion on August 29th left me weak with a dull headache and took about 3 days to start feeling better. The second infusion was a little better and hopefully the third will not effect me at all. Since I am in the last 6 weeks of marathon training I don't need to be taking time off. I ran 5 miles the morning after the first infusion and that was a mistake. But the good news is it is working so far with my trips to the BR reduced to 2-4 times a day. I also have days where I don't go in the evening or at night at all. My doctor hooked me up with Entyvio Connect and when my deductible starts over in July I only Pay $50.00 once a year. I just hope the success continues and the side effects are less. I am blaming Entyvio on the fact that my running pace has dropped way off. I just hope once my body adjust to the drug I regain speed and stamina. Hopefully in time for the Vegas Marathon on November 13th.,entyvio
"We have finally found something we can agree on, that mesalamines can be very valuable tool for IBD and can reduce cancer risk. But you are missing the risks to health posed by the stronger biologics and immunosuppressants. Essentially they suppress your immune system making patients vulnerable to myriad opportunistic infections including cancer:  Somebody said... Another ”black box” was issued in 2008 describing cancer occurring in children and young adults who began taking TNF blockers, such as Remicade, Humira, and Cimzia, along with immunesuppressive medicines such as 6-MP. The FDA “fixed” this problem by updating the 'Warnings' section on the drug label. www.huffingtonpost.com/rebecca-kaplan/social-security-administr_b_6404952.html Patients with IBD depend on medication (antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, steroids, and immunosuppressants) to control the inflammation, ulceration, and pain caused by these diseases. While beneficial, these medications can cause severe side effects including nausea, vomiting, heartburn, night sweats, insomnia, hyperactivity, high blood pressure and stunted growth in children. Patients on immunosuppressants are at risk of developing lymphoma, tuberculosis, kidney and liver damage, anaphylaxis, seizures, and potentially serious or fatal infections. www.adrugrecall.com/remicade/skin-problems/ A May 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association was the first to find that rheumatoid arthritis patients who take Remicade are three times more likely to develop skin cancer than those who don't. I am not saying don't take the big gun meds if they are necessary for remission. But don't ignore that they do have some health risks.  NCOT said... There isn't any food in existence which has been demonstrated to heal the colon/rectum, unlike meds... It's not fashionable to say it but I honestly think 99% of alternative treatments are placebos... pretty much everything that isn't medication I think of as ""alternative"". There are studies on some of these things, but they always seem to be a) tiny and b) piss-poorly designed... The meds that both you and I love so much, mesalamines, are derived from Salicylates which are found in some plants such as white willow bark and wintergreen leaves. Aspirin is also derived from those salicylates which have been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. You cannot get more 'alternative' than that. I guess you believe that the alternatives that largely kept me remission all these years must be “placebo”. But strict double-blind studies have shown that psyllium seed (what I found to be so effective), probiotics such as VSL#3 and Lactobacillus GG, boswellia, curcumin, etc. to be effective for IBD. These were not “piss-poorly” designed but used strict double-blind protocols. If some of the sample sizes were relatively small it can be best explained by the LDN website below, that there is little incentive for large, expensive clinical trials for a drug that cannot produce revenue for Big Pharma. But there is no reason why an IBDer should not try some of them especially if the other option is the “big gun” meds. Some of them worked for me. www.lowdosenaltrexone.org/gazorpa/History.html Naltrexone in substantially lower doses (Low Dose Naltrexone) is showing great promise as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s disease, AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, CFIDS, lupus, and certain forms of cancer. Unfortunately, obtaining FDA approval for LDN will not be a straightforward process. Since naltrexone is now a generic drug, no pharmaceutical company currently holds exclusive manufacturing rights. No company is eager to fund an expensive clinical trial for a drug that will make them so little profit. However, even without governmental approval or corporate support, LDN is gaining significant grass-roots attention among patients and doctors. The exchange of research information over the internet has greatly accelerated the recognition of the off-label use of LDN. Post Edited (IamCurious) : 5/28/2017 6:53:37 PM (GMT-6)",cimzia
"In terms of healthcare and medicine, oral medications for MS are still considered to be in their infancy. Coming onto the market just five years ago, oral medications for MS were saviors for many. They provided relief from the injections I talked about last week and they provided hope for research of the future. When I was first diagnosed, oral treatments seemed like they were still just a thought, a figment of medical imagination. But a few years later they hit the market, to the cheers and sighs of relief of many patients. The first on the scene was Gilenya in 2010. Gilenya is believed to work by preventing certain types of white blood cells from crossing the blood-brain barrier. By doing so, it is believed that this reduces inflammation and damage to nerve cells. Gilenya seemed to be an answer to many MSers prayers, no more shots! But soon after many began taking it, the reports of side effects came out. This is not unusual, as with any drug there are often side effects. But with such a high profile drug, the side effects were high profile as well. One of the main side effects reported was heart issues within the first 24 hours of taking the first dose. And sadly in 2011 an individual experienced the worst side effect possible when they passed away within 24 hours of taking their first dose. This led to regulation changes including having an EEG prior to starting the medication and being monitored for 6 hours in the hospital after receiving a first dosage. Gilenya has also been known to cause vision, breathing or liver problems in some individuals which has prompted some groups to urge the FDA to use more restrictions on the medication. There’s always two sides to every coin though, and some people report wonderful relief from their symptoms and are able to do things they haven’t done in years. Next to emerge was Aubagio in 2012. Aubagio is believed to work by inhibiting the function of specific immune cells that are believed to be present in MS. Patients were happy to have another oral option besides Gilenya, and it proved research was still marching forward. When taking Aubagio, one of the requirements is to have liver enzymes checked regularly as Aubagio could damage the liver. There are also other side effects as well; flushing, hair loss or hair thinning among others. I was on Aubagio for about a year after Copaxone. I experienced major hair loss (at least I thought it was major) and I had a relapse while taking it as well. Clearly my body was telling me it was time to switch! The last oral medication to make its way into the world was Tecfidera in 2013. Tecfidera was formally known as BG-12, it was formulated specifically for people with MS and has been used in Germany at higher doses to treat acute flare ups of psoriasis for years. It is thought to inhibit immune cells and may have specific antioxidant properties that might protect against damage in the brain and spinal cord. The main side effect reported by many individuals when taking Tecfidera is flushing. In 2014 an individual sadly passed away from PML, which prompted more stringent warning labels and JC Virus testing for patients taking Tecfidera. As I mentioned, the only one of these medications I was on (so far) was Aubagio. I experienced what I would consider extreme hair loss (having to clean up the shower and floor every day) and a major relapse while taking it. As for the other possible side effects, I didn’t notice anything else. I loved the idea of being able to take an oral medication for MS instead of an injection, but my body had different plans for me. If I need to transition off of Tysabri in the future, I will definitely look to one of the other oral options before anything else. Like all medications, these come with plenty of side effects. What is important to remember is to always weigh the risk versus benefit. What are tolerable side effects to you? To put it plainly, if the medication is working for you, what are you willing to put up with in order to get that benefit? If your medication makes you feel hot and makes your skin look like a tomato for an hour (flushing), but you’ve been relapse free for a year, which is more important? Or you’ve tested positive for the JC virus, what level of risk is ok with you? Those are definitely tough questions to answer, but with a little honesty and getting real with yourself, it can be done. Husband’s 2 Cents The one oral medication she tried, Aubagio, didn’t work. Her hair fell out and she had a relapse while taking it, which included ‘not subtle’ lesions in her brain. It may be an awesome thing for some people, but unfortunately not for her. I personally never noticed any difference in her hair, but I know she did. It was frustrating to watch her be frustrated.

"Hi everyone, I'm 52 and have had symptoms of central serous retinopathy in one eye for the past 10 years - on and off. I recently went to a new retinal specialist ophthalmologist who said my OCT scan looked like macular degeneration. He did 2 Avastin injections. The wavy lines I was seeing disappeared, but I think my central vision got more blurry and washed out then it had been before. After the Avastin injections the OCT scan showed no change, so he wants to try Lucentis injections. He is not 100% sure I have macular degeneration- it may just be chronic central serous. I'm not sure I want to have more injections in my eye. He says Avastin doesn't cause central blurriness even though I have seen that listed as a side effect, and that has been my experience. Any thoughts or suggestions? Has anyone had any bad reactions to Avastin or Lucentis; or had Central Serous Retinopathy turn into wet macular degeneration?

"I think it's worth up'ing the dose of humira first before trying something new. Although humira can work instantly in some, it can take 5-6 months to work.

"In a subgroup analysis of the phase III FLAURA trial reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , Reungwetwattana et al found evidence of greater central nervous system (CNS) activity of osimertinib (Tagrisso) vs standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with previously untreated advanced EGFR -mutant non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The FLAURA trial supported the recent approval of osimertinib in this setting. Study Details In the trial, 556 patients with EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R) were randomly assigned to receive osimertinib or a standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (gefitinib [Iressa] or erlotinib [Tarceva]) as first-line therapy. Osimertinib was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival. Brain scans were not mandated unless clinically indicated. The current analysis includes 61 osimertinib recipients and 67 standard tyrosine kinase inhibitor recipients, with measureable or nonmeasurable CNS lesions among 200 patients with baseline brain scans, including 22 and 19 with ≥ 1 measureable lesion. The primary outcome measure was CNS progression–free survival assessed by blinded independent central neuroradiologic review. CNS Activity Median CNS progression–free survival among patients with measurable or nonmeasurable CNS lesions was not reached in the osimertinib group (95% confidence interval [CI] = 16.5 months–not calculable) vs 13.9 months (95% CI = 8.3 months–not calculable) in the standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor group (hazard ratio = 0.48, P = .014; nominally significant due to hierarchical testing in the full trial). CNS progression–free survival was 87% vs 71% at 6 months, 77% vs 56% at 12 months, and 58% vs 40% at 18 months. CNS objective response rates were 91% vs 68% in patients with ≥ 1 measurable CNS lesion (odds ratio [OR] = 4.6, P = .066) and 66% vs 43% among patients with measurable or nonmeasurable CNS lesions (OR = 2.5, P = .011). The investigators concluded, “Osimertinib has CNS efficacy in patients with untreated EGFR -mutated non–small cell lung cancer. These results suggest a reduced risk of CNS progression with osimertinib vs standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.” The study was supported by AstraZeneca.

"Hey Adam I started taking Ocrevus last June and have now completed three doses. It’s hard to say whether or not it’s actually working but I don’t feel that my condition is too severe. However, I deafly have the effects of bearing degrees of fatigue in leg weakness so I’m not sure if the fatigue or weakness would be much worse by not taking the medication. I will say that the first half dose was the hardest for me not only an emotional level which I think primarily was due to being overly dosed with benedryl to counter-act the adverse reaction of the medicine. But overall, it hasn’t been too bad despite having to sit thru a 4-5 hour infusion every 6 months. Good luck",ocrevus

"Hello to everyone! I hope you are all doing okay :) I am 24 years old and I have been diagnosed with PPMS 10 months ago. I have severe walking issues, and weakness in my left leg, arm and stiffness in my index finger. First my neurologist asked for an MRI and the results showed lesions in my brain but I was told it was inactive and there were no lesions in my spine. Then I had a lumber puncture and it was positive so the diagnosis was confirmed however ive never had any relapses so PPMS made more sense to my neurologist. 10 months later I recently had another MRI and i was told i have more lesions in my brain but are still inactive and still no lesions in my spine. My symptoms have gone worse and i can hardly walk or use my left arm. I could practically run 2 years ago and im really scared because it is progressing very fast and all these MRI results do not seem to make any sense to me. I have started taking Ocrevus but it is clearly not helping since the progression has not slowed down :( I am mentally very bad and scared because i did not think MS progresses this fast and I’m only 24 ☹️ I don’t understand what they mean by inactive lesions and i don’t know what can help me, i feel really helpless and hopeless :(",ocrevus

"Can I just mention that DMTs are for those with RRMS – think I’m right in saying that.

"January 3, 2019 News breaks in the cancer arena all the time. Sometimes it’s big — like word that a breakthrough drug has increased survival for a hard-to-treat cancer. Sometimes it’s smaller. Any of it may matter to you and your family as you navigate through the cancer journey. We do our best to keep you up-to-date with a weekly roundup of some of the most significant cancer news. Here’s what was new the week of December 31.  Disparities in Breast Cancer Care for Minorities Due to Delays in Diagnosis and Inferior Treatment What’s new: Black and Hispanic women have worse breast cancer outcomes compared to white women due to delays in diagnosis and treatment at under-resourced health centers, according to research published in the January 2019 issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention . Researchers from the University of Illinois in Chicago looked at data from more than 900 people with breast cancer in Chicago, representing a range of ethnic groups. They found that, compared with white women, black and Hispanic women were more likely to be diagnosed at under-resourced health clinics (37 percent for black women, 47 percent for Hispanic women, and 11 percent for white women). Black and Hispanic women were also more likely to be referred to more than one facility and to experience a diagnostic delay in excess of 60 days (27 percent for black women, 32 percent for Hispanic women, and 12 percent for white women). Black and Hispanic women were less likely to be diagnosed at a facility designated as a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence and less likely to have breast cancer initially detected through screening. Why it matters: The study showed that people who were treated in poorer, medically under-resourced hospitals and clinics suffered the consequences of their locations. At the time of the study, the authors noted, Chicago had 11 centers that were designated as a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence, yet many people received mammograms and diagnostic follow-up imaging at unaccredited facilities. Many minority women were limited by their health insurance regarding the choice of healthcare provider. More effort should be made to increase referrals to a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence and assist more facilities in obtaining that designation, the authors said. RELATED: Breast Cancer More Lethal for Blacks Than Whites  Lots of Small Side Effects Reduce Quality of Life for People With Cancer What’s new: An accumulation of toxicities linked to cancer treatment can erode a person's quality of life as much as severe adverse events, according to research published in the December 2018 issue of the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network . The study explored the effects of treatments on 184 people enrolled in phase III randomized clinical trials for prostate cancer. Participants completed quality of life assessments before treatment, after three months of treatment, and after six months of treatment. Treatment toxicity data was reported by both doctors and patients. The study showed that the biggest impact on quality of life came from an accumulation of adverse events, regardless of whether the events were minor or severe. Patients' scores were linked more closely to quality of life outcomes than doctors' scores. Why it matters: The study suggests that the toxic side effects of cancer treatments should be assessed more frequently. Doctors should pay close attention to the accumulation of even minor side effects instead of focusing solely on major adverse events, the authors said. The use of electronic data collection may be one way to improve the reporting of side effects. RELATED: New Guidelines Issued to Address Side Effects Linked to Cancer Immunotherapies  Deadly Brain Cancer May Differ in Men and Women What’s new: Men are more likely to develop and die from the brain cancer glioblastoma than women, according to a study published in January 2019 in the journal Science Translational Medicine , which also revealed that the disease differs in men and women and that those differences may account for the disparities in the way patients respond to treatment. The study, from scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, featured an analysis of MRI scans and survival data from a cancer research database. The researchers looked at 63 patients (40 men and 23 women) during treatment. They found that only women showed a steady decline in tumor growth after treatment with the chemotherapy drug Temodar (temozolomide) . When looking at the genetics of the tumors, they found different molecular subtypes of the disease that corresponded to differences in survival between men and women. Why it matters: The research could have an immediate impact on both research and treatment of glioblastoma, the researchers said. In studies of the disease, findings should be stratified by male and female risk groups, they said. This approach could lead to sex-specific treatment approaches. “I hope the research will inspire more specific approaches to treatments. It may be that we shouldn’t be using the same criteria when treating diseases in [men and women], and as a next step, we should definitely develop and evaluate sex-specific treatment regimens for glioblastoma,” said Joshua B. Rubin, MD, PhD , a Washington University professor of pediatrics and neuroscience and the study’s co-senior author. RELATED: Glioblastoma Treatment: How Do Doctors Treat This Brain Tumor?  Study Yields Clue on Ways to Prevent Esophageal Cancer What’s new: Scientists have identified a gene variation that may explain why esophageal cancer is more common in people who are white. The study, published online in December 2018 by the journal Gastroenterology , also suggests a possible prevention strategy. University of Michigan researchers explored the question of why people who are white develop esophageal adenocarcinoma much more often than people who are black. They examined tissue samples from people of both racial groups, including people with esophageal cancer and those without the disease. The study showed that people who are black have a higher level of an enzyme called GSTT2 compared to those who are white. The enzyme protects against oxidative damage to cells, such as the cell damage that occurs in people with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) . The study explored the use of an extract containing flavonoids from cranberries to reduce cell damage from reflux. Why it matters: More than 17,000 Americans will be diagnosed with esophageal cancer this year. Adenocarcinoma represents about two-thirds of cases. The authors note that GERD occurs at similar rates in those who are black and white, but that those who are black rarely develop esophageal adenocarcinoma. More research is needed to find ways to limit the cell damage from reflux disease that leads to esophageal adenocarcinoma, the authors said. RELATED: Cancer Research News: A Weekly Roundup of New Developments in Cancer Research and Treatment  Artificial Intelligence May Help Predict Cancer Treatment Side Effects What’s new: An artificial intelligence program can accurately predict the severity of three common problems faced by people with cancer — depression , anxiety , and sleep disturbance — according to a study published in December 2018 in the journal PLOS One . Researchers at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom and the University of California in San Francisco analyzed data on depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance experienced by people with cancer and found that the symptoms reported were similar to those predicted by the machine-learning models they created. Why it matters: Depression, anxiety, and sleep problems are major reasons why people with cancer suffer poorer quality of life during treatment. Having methods to better predict who may experience these side effects may lead to preventive treatment or a faster response to problems. ""These exciting results show that there is an opportunity for machine-learning techniques to make a real difference in the lives of people living with cancer,” said Payam Barnaghi , a professor of machine intelligence at the University of Surrey. “They can help clinicians identify high-risk patients, help and support their symptom experience, and preemptively plan a way to manage those symptoms and improve quality of life."" RELATED: Coping With Anxiety When You Have Metastatic Breast Cancer  Analysis Shows Tremendous Progress for Some People With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer What’s new: About half of people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have an ALK gene mutation are living more than six years after diagnosis today compared to only 2 percent of those diagnosed with the disease between 1995 and 2001, according to a study published online in December 2018 by the Journal of Thoracic Oncology . The study compared outcomes of people diagnosed between 1995 and 2001 and those diagnosed between 2009 and 2017. Researchers found an overall median survival rate of 6.8 years for people with stage IV disease, the most advanced stage of cancer, treated at UC Health University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora between 2009 and 2017. Almost all of the patients were treated with the drug Xalkori (crizotinib) as their initial therapy, which was approved for people with NSCLC with an ALK-positive mutation in 2011. Why it matters: The study showed the impact of targeted therapies, such as Xalkori, for NSCLC. Progress has also been made in the choice of chemotherapy used in people with NSCLC, the authors said. Several new ALK drugs have been developed since Xalkori. RELATED: Mapping Your Mutations: What Everyone With Lung Cancer Needs to Know  How a Poor Diet May Contribute to Breast Cancer What’s new: Women with estrogen-positive breast cancer may not respond as well to the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex, Genox, Tamifen) if they have a high level of substances called advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are linked to a poor diet, according to research published in December 2018 in the journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment . The study by researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston found that a high AGEs level helped activate cellular pathways that promote cancer cell growth. AGEs were found to help turn on a protein called estrogen receptor alpha in breast cancer cells. Adding tamoxifen limited the cancer cell growth, but adding AGEs triggered the cells to grow again. Why it matters: AGEs may help explain why certain lifestyle behaviors, such as diet, affect the chances that cancer therapies will be effective, the authors said. The AGEs level is increased by eating processed foods that are high in sugar and fat and by certain cooking techniques, such as frying and grilling. The authors suggest that a defined lifestyle intervention of exercise and a healthy diet could lower AGEs in overweight women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, perhaps improving outcomes. RELATED: 12 Foods to Add to Your Diet for Breast Cancer Prevention  Opioid Problems Can Develop During Treatment for Head And Neck Cancer What’s new: Some people treated for head and neck cancer may develop addiction to opioid pain relievers once cancer treatment ends, according to research published online in November 2018 by the journal Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery . Researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora looked at data on 976 people treated for head and neck cancer between 2008 and 2011. Among them, 811 received prescriptions for opioid pain medications. Three months after treatment ended, 150 continued to have active opioid prescriptions. Six months after treatment, 68 (7 percent) were still using opioids. People prescribed oxycodone (Oxycontin, Oxaydo, Xtampza) as their first opiate were less likely to continue use than those initially prescribed hydrocodone (Norco, Lorcet, Vicodin) or other opiates, including fentanyl (Duragesic, Abstral, Ionsys) , hydromorphone , Demerol (meperidine hydrochloride) , morphine (Roxanol, Kadian, Avinza) , nalbuphine (Nubain, Nalpain, Rubophine) , or tramadol (Ultram, ConZip) . Why it matters: The study confirms suspicions that opioid dependence or addiction may be a risk for people with head and neck cancer, the authors said, noting that opioids should not be needed six months after treatment concludes. More effort is needed to manage pain better in people with head and neck cancer while reducing the risk of dependence, the authors said, including counseling patients on the risk.

"Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person on this forum who didn't obsess over their diagnosis. I can't imagine obsessing over incredibly mild symptoms that aren't interfering with your life, because I never did it myself. Obviously if my disease had started off severe, it might have been a different story but it didn't: it started off extremely mild and stayed that way - symptomatically at least - for another five years. I was utterly clueless in other words. But what good would it have done me if I wasn't? I probably wouldn't have been able to alter the eventual outcome, because there is no evidence that any medication - except for perhaps biologics and it's too soon to really tell with those yet - alters the natural history of IBD, i.e. those who are gonna need surgery still need surgery. Frankly I wish I could go back to those days of not giving a darn. Crohn's is gonna do whatever it does, and you spending hour after hour researching it isn't going to change that. I did eventually reach that stage of obsessive research and it didn't change a thing, other than making me know more about Crohn's than most doctors. Dx Crohn's in summer of 2000. (Yay  ) Tried and failed: 5-ASAs, azathioprine, 6MP, Remicade, methotrexate, Humira, various diets. Had surgery Feb '13 - subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy.

"Reply posted for justmarie17. I have been on remicade since 2013. Ever since, the hospital has claimed that I'm in remission based on their studies and blood work results. Despite that false claim, I still have occasional bloody stools, frequent symptoms and side effects such as mouth sores, psoriasis, abdominal cramping, etc. So we finally switched hospitals, and the new GI wants to switch me to Stalera, which is much newer and so far appears to be more effective. I haven't started my first Stalera treatment yet, because I am seeing if natural remedies like a healthy diet, correct vitamin supplements, exercise, and a little pot ;) may be able to make a difference without the biologic in my system. So far, I feel much better than when I was on remicade! If I experience less symptoms, I'll probably keep my treatment as is. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!",remicade
From what I gather the PML risk is with any immunosupressant. My neurologist said within the first year the risk of PML is not even a concern. Even after the year on it your bloods are monitored every 3 months. Even then the risk of PML with Gilenya is lower then other DMD’s on the market. The benefits outweigh the risk to me and I am willing to try what’s out there to slow this down. Sometimes we have to take that leap into the unknown and have a little faith.,gilenya
"Paul: What would you say about your current symptoms? Dave Bexfield, MSers Expert and founder of Active MSers: Well, that’s interesting because for the first… right after the treatment, that’s when the biggest change occurred. I would say in the first two months I went from walking barely a hundred metres, I could put in 500, 600, even 700 metres. And then by year one I could hike for maybe two miles, with rest. My longest hike was maybe two and a half, maybe three miles, in one day. But – and this is a but, and this is unfortunate but it happens – even though I was the ideal candidate for this treatment, I started to backslide about year four. That would have been 2014 or so. I noticed that I wasn’t doing quite as well and in 2015 in my last study update, I could do 200 metres unaided, not quite. And now, unfortunately, I’m back to using my walker, which is a little bit frustrating. I’m better in pretty much every other area. Cognition is fine, my vision is fine, I don’t have any fatigue. I’m doing, for someone with MS, actually pretty well, but my legs aren’t doing great. So in 2015 I started on a new treatment, I started on Aubagio, and then that wasn’t really cutting it, so then a year after that I went on to Rituxan, so right now I’m on Rituxan, I might switch over to Ocrevus if my insurance company says sure. So we’ll see. Would I do it again? Oh hell, yeah. I mean it saved my life, but it was not a cure, at least in my case.

"Damn. Another two weeks have gone by since my February post, with a few more appointments and doctor visits, and even more new consultations added. With my Crohn’s disease journey, I’ve not felt any different having started the Stelara . I had my follow-up with GI, Dr. S, this past week, and I got to explain everything to her.   The few weeks after my Stelara infusion, my urgency and bowel pain has been flaring. I’ve spent most of my time in our spare bathroom (read: my second office) and my symptoms are running wild here lately. I mentioned to her that I’ve been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and I would like to take the time to write a blog focusing on that specifically, but I’m still researching on it. She asked about my perianal disease, luckily no more abscesses or fistulas, only a fissure here and there – ouch ! She told me the Stelara could take 6-8 weeks for effect, so around the time of my first self-injection of this medication. The Stelara needles are very different from the Humira pens I have used in the past, with the automatic button and small needle that you don’t see. The Stelara shots have more of a ‘normal’ needle style, with the patient watching the needle go into the skin. I’ll have to inject a few times a year and I can do it at home, luckily. Around the time of my injection and the time I should be expecting to feel better, in around a month, I’ll have another follow-up with Dr. S in GI to see how I am maintaining. And then later this week, I met with plastic surgery for another follow-up appointment.   Taking my blood pressure and my temperature was an event in the plastic surgery department for me. As per usual, my temperature was a little high. I seem to always have a low-grade fever. I blame being immunocompromised for always keeping me constantly feeling cold but running a fever. When they went to check my blood pressure, they thought I was suffering a heart attack! My blood pressure was sky-rocket high, even after sitting in the waiting area for a good 40 minutes. They hooked up my right arm, and it was nuts. He told me it was so high it was in heart attack range, that this is something they would take me to the ER immediately for. The nurse was shocked and went to tell his doctor. Then, they tried my left arm and right arm again. They did this a few times and asked if I’d ever had a valve or blood pressure issue? I told them I hadn’t. There wasn’t any issue with the left arm, only the right. After a few re-dos, they decided that it was a possible fluke, they couldn’t explain it, they logged it in my medical chart. The doctor, Dr. R, looked at my ganglion cyst surgery scar, the reason for this follow-up. My cyst area is still tender and my range of movement is nonexistent. I have to baby my left hand still, not using it as much as I can avoid. Certain movements send shooting pain in my nerves and my grip is still weak. The doctor looked at my scar, moved my wrist and thumb around, which was very uncomfortable. He almost seen surprised when he said ‘it doesn’t look like its coming back’, almost as if to insinuate a ‘yet’ at the end of it. The doctor told me that I would probably still have pain and tenderness, that I could wear a brace if it helps. He told me that they wanted to see me again in three months to make sure that it wasn’t coming back and to see if I’m still having nerve pain with it. I mentioned that I have been taking Gabapentin for other unrelated nerve pains and that it helps some with the hand. Now, my other hand. Remember I couldn’t get my MRI because of my septum piercing. I had called the VA about rescheduling it for an outside source who would perform it with my nose ring, and I had talked to a lady about the appointment not happening that day. She told me she would call back, but she didn’t. I called the VA after a week of hearing nothing and I was told there was another representative that I had to talk to, but she was at lunch. I called later that afternoon, was transferred around 4 times, only to be told that I would have to talk to my primary care team about it. So, I called primary care. When I talked to my nurse, she told me that primary care had a hard time scheduling outside visits but since this was a musculoskeletal issue, perhaps they could set up the referral. While I had my nurse on the phone, I mentioned my rib issues that never were resolved. In January, I had had an X-ray on my ribs after seeing primary care, since there is an area of inflammation on one single rib. I had mentioned it to my primary care doctor, Dr. C, and she had felt around my left side rib, noting that there was a swollen area. (See Ganglionectomy ) After the x-ray’s, I got a letter stating that my lungs were clear but with no real answers as to why? When I asked my nurse about it, she was a little confused and kept bringing up my right side breast and never pain in relation. Please note, these pains are unrelated. The breast nerve pain, it is like an electric shock happens sporadically, sending a shock up the outside of my right breast. Why? I still don’t know an answer other than it is nerve pain… The left-sided rib pain and swelling, it is like a lump on or near the very bottom rib on the left side. Sometimes it feels larger than normal, it feels sore to the touch, and it is always in the same spot. Comparing the right side, there is nothing, no lump, no swelling, just ribs. I expressed this to the nurse, and she told me she would ask Dr. C and return my call. When she called back, Dr. C had told her that the x-rays were clear but she knows there is a nodule of sorts on this one rib. She told me that I would need a new consult, to General Surgery, to find out what it is, why its there, and if it needs removal. My luck, it will need surgery but I’ll not get ahead of myself – knock on wood. Fingers crossed I don’t! I’ll have the general surgery consultation this upcoming week, I’m sure it’ll require more appointments and a scan of sorts, whether it be another x-ray or MRI to be had. Sometimes, I feel like I live at the VA. And not only do I visit the VA, but I’m constantly calling them. I’ve already had 14 appointments this year, with 4 future appointments already planned.   I had to call the VA for another matter this week, my prescriptions. I went online for a print out of my current medication list and some of my medications, my Crohn’s disease pill that I take daily, Imuran, and my mental health medication, Lexapro, they had been marked discontinued. I had to call and request they be marked as active again. I had mentioned to GI during my last visit that I needed to refill my Imuran soon but it was most likely forgotten and I haven’t seen mental health since there was an invasion of my privacy, I was worried they’d make me have another visit before letting me refill my prescription. Luckily, this was an easy fix and their active status is back to normal. Otherwise, in the past few weeks, I’ve gotten more insomnia. I thought perhaps this problem had been helped with my Melatonin and Mirtazapine but I’ve had more than a few late nights again here lately.   Always Another Appointment – It Could Be Worse Blog  Always Another Appointment – It Could Be Worse Blog Sometimes I can fall asleep but I wake in the middle of the night, restless. Sometimes I can’t fall asleep until my body crashes, sometimes after 5 am. I’ve not even been doing my face or hair lately, either. I’ve not shared social media stories daily or been as active. I’ve been home most days in pajamas when I’m not at the VA. I hope that helps explain why there is a lack of images in this post, usually I have a bunch throughout but I think I only have less than a handful in this one…and not a single selfie! My body hurts, my back, my stomach, my head, my hands, so this time has been pretty uneventful. I did make a medication bottle wreath from my hoarding mess of medicine bottles from my last couple years. You may have seen already through social media, but I keep each bottle like I do with my wristbands from procedures, and I decided to make a wreath for my office (read: my real office). I still have a ton more, I thought about creating one for the VA, maybe GI would like to have one?   I also signed up for Lexington Take Steps walk this year for Crohn’s and Colitis. I had participated in 2016, I dropped the ball last year and forgot to register, so I made sure to register early this year. It will be held at Whitaker Ball Park, Lexington, on September 16, 2018.

I prefer donations go towards Cure for IBD because 100% goes to research, unlike other fundraising pages.   I know I had mentioned in my last post about starting a new job and I did go in for the first day. I learned the ropes, the expectations and everything about the job but it was completely different than what I’d been told in my two interviews with the company. I thanked them for the opportunity and I have continued to look elsewhere. It is harder than it looks when you have to think about your health when job searching. I have to think of hours, how the job feels about appointment availability and doctors visits that can happen with little time in advance, the details of the job and what is required, as well as worrying about my wellbeing and how my body will feel every single day. If it weren’t for my hands being difficult, I’d be doing phlebotomy. If I could 100% choose what I do, I would love to focus on writing and journalism. I know what I will and will not do, it is just a matter of finding that right ‘fit’ and thinking about my Crohn’s and Fibromyalgia and everything else that is wrong with me.

"Oh! that's a relief because I was a bit worried. I'm sure I will get it...thanks The other thing I am concerned about is that I read on here that Remicade can cause mouth ulcers. I have a rare condition (of course I do!!) called Oral Lichen Planus. It is a chronic inflammatory condition. After my first infusion, it flared up quite badly. This is the first time this has happened in years, and it can be very serious and so it terrifies me to think that it might become a problem for me. Oral Lichen Planus at its worse is off the scale and it presents itself with multiple mouth ulcers usually under and alongside the side of the tongue, and always with white lacy patches of skin everywhere in the mouth, and with swollen gums/tissue. In some cases, it can become hard to eat. I will just have to pray that this does not happen, but it's a concern. Samantha Stopped smoking Jan 2013. Diagnosed Left sided UC, 8th Feb 2014.

"Was hoping for better news. Finished chemoradiation on November 16th. They gave me a month to recover before having any scans. Took that long for me to be able to swallow again. Lost about 10 lbs. Met with doctor on December 21st. Lung tumor has shrunk some. New lymph node in chest lit up. They also have determined that cancer has spread to my adrenal gland and is now stage IV. Will start keytruda on January 7th. If after 2 scans there is no more spread, they will remove the adrenal gland and hopefully restage back to 3b. All of this is overwhelming. Not sure how to deal. Can’t seem to catch a break. You have to stay as strong as you have been as I'm watching.and spurring every one on as my path.will be starting soon I hope on our way back to healthxxx",keytruda
"Hi, I wonder whether re using afatinib may benefit my mom again. She was previously on the drug for about six months with very good results. When it stopped working, and even then the progression was quite slow, she was found positive for t790m, and started Tagrisso. However, she, from the get go, didn’t seem to do well on the Tagrisso, and when we got our scan 3 months later it showed dramatic progression. We did another biopsy and sent it to foundation one and it showed no t790m, it did show the original exon 21 and several others, including the very problematic mutation, KRAS. Her mutations load was also quite high, so immunotherapy was listed as a viable option. She recently started Opdivo, 2 infusions thus far, unfortunately by the time she went into the clinic to get her third one she fell and fractured her hip, she went into surgery couple of days later. As I understand, it takes time for any immunotherapy drug to work, as of the need to get to a critical mass sufficient enough to trigger one’s immune system into action. With mom’s very progressive disease (she doesn’t feel well at all, doesn’t eat, sleeps a lot, and has right side abdominal pain, probably from the liver mets), I think it’s critical to put her on a drug that works fast without having to wait too long. So my question is, would it be possible for her to take afatinib again, it would be about six months since the last time she took it, and it makes sense that some cancer cells, especially the new ones, would be sensitive to the drug. We need to stabilize her situation, to have enough spare for her to have the time to wait when trying Opdivo again. I’d greatly appreciate your thoughts, insights, or experience on re challenging afatinib. Thank you all, Ilan",tagrisso
"A personal opinion I will share for what it's worth. Firstly, you, your family & of course your son are to be commended for everything you are doing. I have to declare my position is that I think every lesion visible on MRI or evident clinically is a concern ongoing damage can be occurring which overwhelms your CNS's ability to heal unless stopped and I choose to add DMT's. I have been OMS from 2012 when I was diagnosed but took a couple of months and a relapse to be fully compliant. My biggest failing and regret was underdoing the megadoses to get my vitamin D high enough. I started DMT as well but before it reached full activity I relapsed and it is only 4 years later that I am clawing back the ground I lost then, mainly independent walking, despite being free of further relapse and having stable or better MRI's. At diagnosis I was offered tysabri. That was largely due to the multitude of lesions (impossible to count so many in brain and long continuous lesions in cord) of varying activity present & influenced by being unable to walk then. I initially planned to start tysabri but in the fortnight until my follow up appointment I learnt about PML & rebound plus I had the thought that if I went straight to the most effective drug (at the time) & failed I had nowhere else to go. PML is my bogey man; I can think of nothing worse. The improvement I had with steroids & rehab undoubtedly influenced me too. So I chose Gilenya instead. After the decision was made we got the results back for JCV & I am positive so I was glad I opted out of tysabri (but strongly endorse the information that risk is there but what I agree is acceptable for 2 years. It is just that you don't know if you will suffer rebound on cessation. Many who stabilise their disease will prefer to risk PML than relapse. There is excellent resources on the website  http://multiple-sclerosis-research.blogspot.com/search . The include PML risk calculator, bridging strategies for switching to other drugs and a terrific search engine for an enormous amount of topics backed up by data and ms professionals as well as opinions from members). Subsequent case reports have shown Gilenya is also susceptible to PML & rebound, just at lower frequencies. It does sway me to stay on it though rather than try stopping and trusting to OMS alone. I now think about that leap but relapse & rebound scare me equally. Plus there isn't another drug currently available in Australia that I would take. For what it's worth, If I had highly active ms I would choose alemtuzumab but it's risk-benefit is unacceptable otherwise. When ocreluzimab gets through the approval process I will look at it unless other considerations arise. Sorry for going on so long but I respect the question and research you have done All the best for you all, Judy",gilenya
"by Thomas M. Jenkins For September 2018, we have selected: Katzenschlager R, Poewe W, Rascol O, et al. Apomorphine subcutaneous infusion in patients with Parkinson’s disease with persisten motor fluctuations (TOLEDO): a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial . Lancet Neurol July 25, 2018. doi:10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30284-4. Subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine, a potent dopamine receptor agonist, is widely used in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) with motor fluctuations not optimally controlled with oral medication, but the previous evidence base to support this approach was weak, derived from open label studies. Our paper of the month reports the first randomized placebo-controlled trial of subcutaneous apomorphine in PD. This phase III “TOLEDO” trial was positive, establishing an evidence base for current clinical practice. The lead investigators are based in Vienna and patients were recruited from 23 European hospitals. Inclusion criteria were age >30 years, idiopathic PD diagnosed for at least 3 years, based on modified Queen Square Brain Bank criteria, with motor fluctuations not adequately controlled on optimal conventional medical treatment, defined as four or more daily doses of levodopa, and as individually assessed by the investigators. Patients had to fulfill Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 or less when “on”, and 2-5 when “off”. No changes to usual medication were allowed for four weeks prior to study entry, and patient ability to accurately document symptoms in their diaries was assessed. A mean of more than three hours “off’ time/day and no days with fewer than two hours “off” time was required to be eligible for study entry Exclusion criteria included previous surgical treatment for PD, previous use of apomorphine, recent treatment with intrajejunal levodopa, falls due to severe freezing, or significant postural instability during “on” time, mini-mental state examination less than 25/30, recent psychosis of at least moderate severity within the previous year (mild visual hallucinations with preserved insight were allowed), or prolonged QT interval. Patients were randomly allocated to apomorphine or placebo saline infusion, and initiated as inpatients, for up to 18 hours a day, for 12 weeks. Domperidone was given concurrently as necessary. It was allowed to adjust flow rates during the first four weeks, as well as other oral medications, according to individual patient response, but all study participants and investigators were masked to assigned treatment. No further changes in apomorphine dose were allowed for the remaining eight weeks in the study. Limited rescue doses of levodopa were allowed. The primary outcome measure was the absolute change in “off” time, between baseline and 12 weeks, documented from patient diaries. Secondary outcomes included changes in on-time without troublesome dyskinesia, change in levodopa-equivalent medication dose, UPDRS motor examination scores and the PDQ-8 quality of life measure. Patients with efficacy data for any time-point were included in the analysis. Missing data for the primary endpoint were imputed using a last observation carried forward approach. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare treatment groups. Data from 106 patients were analyzed, 53 treated with apomorphine, and 53 with placebo, of whom 71 patients completed the full 12 weeks treatment. Apomorphine at a mean dose of 4.7 mg/hour was found to reduce “off” time by 1.9 hours/day compared with placebo (95% CI -0.6 to -3.2 hours/day, p=0.0025). Common side effects were skin reactions, nausea and somnolence. Six patients in the apomorphine group withdrew due to side effects (one severe hypotension, one leukopenia/anemia, one visual hallucinations, one gait disturbance, one skin reaction, one (unrelated) myocardial infarction. There was no change in UPDRS motor scores or PDQ-8 quality of life measures, but the apomorphine group achieved more “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias and greater reductions in levodopa-equivalent medication doses. The authors concluded that subcutaneous apomorphine provides clinically meaningful benefits in “off” time in PD. A 12 month open-label extension study is now being performed. “This study represents an important step in establishing optimal treatment regimes for patients with more advanced PD who no longer fully respond to oral treatment”, said Professor Philippe Damier, Department of Neurology, University of Nantes, France. “Whilst a limitation inherent in testing apomorphine is that it is difficult to fully blind participants and assessors, and an imputational statistical approach had to be used because of cohort drop-out rates, overall the rigorous trial methodology provides the best class evidence to date for the benefits of apomorphine, and the positive treatment effect appears meaningful and concordant with clinical experience.” “This could now pave the way for future trials comparing the different advanced therapies, for example subcutaneous apomorphine and intra-jejunal approaches”, said the leading author of the paper, Pr. Regina Katzenschlager, Department of Neurology, Danube Hospital Vienna, Austria, “and help optimize management for individuals with PD who are no longer responding to oral treatment.” The other nominees for the September 2018 Paper of the month are: Rothwell PM, Cook NR, Gaziano JM, et al.  Effects of aspirin on risks of vascular events and cancer according to bodyweight and dose: analysis of individual patients’ data from randomized trials . Lancet Neurol July 12, 2018; doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31133-4. In this study, the authors analyzed the effects of different doses of aspirin according to body weight and dose in the long-term primary prevention of cardiovascular events and cancer, stratifying patients by age and sex. As main findings, ≤100 mg aspirin was effective only in patients weighting ≤70 kg, whereas ≥300 mg aspirin were effective only in patients weighting ≥70 Kg. Further research about aspirin dose and bodyweight interaction is clearly needed. Ludolph AC, Schuster J, Dorst J, et al., on behalf of the RAS-ALS Study.  Safety and efficacy of rasagiline as an add-on therapy to riluzole in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial. Lancet Neurol June 19, 2018; doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30176-5. In this German phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 1mg rasagiline was studied in 273 patients with possible, probable or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). At 18 months, no differences between rasagiline and placebo was found related to survival time. Post-hoc analysis suggested that rasagiline could have modifying disease effect in those patients with initial slope of ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised greater than 0.5 per month at baseline.

"SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with Remicade  ® are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Remicade should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before Remicade use and during therapy.  1,2 Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to Remicade use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. The risks and benefits of treatment with Remicade should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Remicade, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including Remicade  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including Remicade. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported Remicade cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and most were in adolescent and young adult males.  Indications and Usage for Remicade See also: Stelara Crohn's Disease Remicade is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Remicade is indicated for reducing the number of draining enterocutaneous and rectovaginal fistulas and maintaining fistula closure in adult patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease.  Pediatric Crohn's Disease Remicade is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.  Ulcerative Colitis Remicade is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing and maintaining clinical remission and mucosal healing, and eliminating corticosteroid use in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.  Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Remicade is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.  Rheumatoid Arthritis Remicade, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.  Ankylosing Spondylitis Remicade is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.  Psoriatic Arthritis Remicade is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of active arthritis, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis.  Plaque Psoriasis Remicade is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic severe (i.e., extensive and/or disabling) plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy and when other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate. Remicade should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a physician  [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .  Remicade Dosage and Administration Crohn's Disease The recommended dose of Remicade is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease or fistulizing Crohn's disease. For adult patients who respond and then lose their response, consideration may be given to treatment with 10 mg/kg. Patients who do not respond by Week 14 are unlikely to respond with continued dosing and consideration should be given to discontinue Remicade in these patients.  Pediatric Crohn's Disease The recommended dose of Remicade for pediatric patients 6 years and older with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks.  Ulcerative Colitis The recommended dose of Remicade is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.  Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis The recommended dose of Remicade for pediatric patients 6 years and older with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks.  Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dose of Remicade is 3 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Remicade should be given in combination with methotrexate. For patients who have an incomplete response, consideration may be given to adjusting the dose up to 10 mg/kg or treating as often as every 4 weeks bearing in mind that risk of serious infections is increased at higher doses  [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dose of Remicade is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks thereafter for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis.  Psoriatic Arthritis The recommended dose of Remicade is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Remicade can be used with or without methotrexate.  Plaque Psoriasis The recommended dose of Remicade is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of chronic severe (i.e., extensive and/or disabling) plaque psoriasis.  Monitoring to Assess Safety Prior to initiating Remicade and periodically during therapy, patients should be evaluated for active tuberculosis and tested for latent infection  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  Administration Instructions Regarding Infusion Reactions Adverse effects during administration of Remicade have included flu-like symptoms, headache, dyspnea, hypotension, transient fever, chills, gastrointestinal symptoms, and skin rashes. Anaphylaxis might occur at any time during Remicade infusion. Approximately 20% of Remicade-treated patients in all clinical trials experienced an infusion reaction compared with 10% of placebo-treated patients  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Prior to infusion with Remicade, premedication may be administered at the physician's discretion. Premedication could include antihistamines (anti-H1 +/- anti-H2), acetaminophen and/or corticosteroids. During infusion, mild to moderate infusion reactions may improve following slowing or suspension of the infusion, and upon resolution of the reaction, reinitiation at a lower infusion rate and/or therapeutic administration of antihistamines, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids. For patients that do not tolerate the infusion following these interventions, Remicade should be discontinued. During or following infusion, patients who have severe infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions should be discontinued from further Remicade treatment. The management of severe infusion reactions should be dictated by the signs and symptoms of the reaction. Appropriate personnel and medication should be available to treat anaphylaxis if it occurs.  General Considerations and Instructions for Preparation and Administration Remicade is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician. The reconstituted infusion solution should be prepared by a trained medical professional using aseptic technique by the following procedure: Calculate the dose, total volume of reconstituted Remicade solution required and the number of Remicade vials needed. Each Remicade vial contains 100 mg of the infliximab antibody. Reconstitute each Remicade vial with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, using a syringe equipped with a 21-gauge or smaller needle as follows: Remove the flip-top from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial through the center of the rubber stopper and direct the stream of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to the glass wall of the vial. Gently swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilized powder. Avoid prolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 minutes. The solution should be colorless to light yellow and opalescent, and the solution may develop a few translucent particles as infliximab is a protein. Do not use if the lyophilized cake has not fully dissolved or if opaque particles, discoloration, or other foreign particles are present. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted Remicade solution dose to 250 mL with sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, by withdrawing a volume equal to the volume of reconstituted Remicade from the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 250 mL bottle or bag. Do not dilute the reconstituted Remicade solution with any other diluent. Slowly add the total volume of reconstituted Remicade solution to the 250 mL infusion bottle or bag. Gently mix. The resulting infusion concentration should range between 0.4 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL. The Remicade infusion should begin within 3 hours of reconstitution and dilution. The infusion must be administered over a period of not less than 2 hours and must use an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding filter (pore size of 1.2 µm or less). The vials do not contain antibacterial preservatives. Therefore, any unused portion of the infusion solution should not be stored for reuse. No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co-administration of Remicade with other agents. Remicade should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually before and after reconstitution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If visibly opaque particles, discoloration or other foreign particulates are observed, the solution should not be used.  Dosage Forms and Strengths 100 mg vial: 100 mg lyophilized infliximab in a 20 mL vial for injection, for intravenous use.  Contraindications Remicade at doses >5 mg/kg should not be administered to patients with moderate to severe heart failure. In a randomized study evaluating Remicade in patients with moderate to severe heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III/IV), Remicade treatment at 10 mg/kg was associated with an increased incidence of death and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Remicade should not be re-administered to patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction to Remicade. Additionally, Remicade should not be administered to patients with known hypersensitivity to inactive components of the product or to any murine proteins.  Warnings and Precautions Serious Infections Patients treated with Remicade are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or parasitic organisms including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis, salmonellosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF-blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. Treatment with Remicade should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including clinically important localized infections. Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids or methotrexate may be at greater risk of infection. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients:  with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Tuberculosis Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving Remicade, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Cases of active tuberculosis have also occurred in patients being treated with Remicade during treatment for latent tuberculosis. Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating Remicade and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Induration of 5 mm or greater with tuberculin skin testing should be considered a positive test result when assessing if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed prior to initiating Remicade, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to initiation of Remicade in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Tuberculosis should be strongly considered in patients who develop a new infection during Remicade treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.  Monitoring Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Remicade, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Remicade. Remicade should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Remicade should be closely monitored, undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated.  Invasive Fungal Infections For patients who reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, invasive fungal infection should be suspected if they develop a serious systemic illness. Appropriate empiric antifungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. When feasible, the decision to administer empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections and should take into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy.  Malignancies Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy ≤18 years of age), including Remicade. Approximately half of these cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of malignancies, including rare malignancies that are usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months (range 1 to 84 months) after the first dose of TNF blocker therapy. Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources, including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports.  Lymphomas In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blocking agents, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF blocker compared with control patients. In the controlled and open-label portions of Remicade clinical trials, 5 patients developed lymphomas among 5707 patients treated with Remicade (median duration of follow-up 1.0 years) vs. 0 lymphomas in 1600 control patients (median duration of follow-up 0.4 years). In rheumatoid arthritis patients, 2 lymphomas were observed for a rate of 0.08 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up, which is approximately three-fold higher than expected in the general population. In the combined clinical trial population for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and plaque psoriasis, 5 lymphomas were observed for a rate of 0.10 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up, which is approximately four-fold higher than expected in the general population. Patients with Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis or plaque psoriasis, particularly patients with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF-blocking therapy. Cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported with postmarketing TNF-blocker use in rheumatoid arthritis and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF blocker therapy, patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.  Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (HSTCL) Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including Remicade. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported Remicade cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and most were in adolescent and young adult males. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to TNF-blockers or TNF-blockers in combination with these other immunosuppressants. When treating patients, consideration of whether to use Remicade alone or in combination with other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine should take into account a possibility that there is a higher risk of HSTCL with combination therapy versus an observed increased risk of immunogenicity and hypersensitivity reactions with Remicade monotherapy from the clinical trial data  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  Skin Cancer Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF blocker therapy, including Remicade  [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer.  ​ Cervical Cancer ​ A population-based retrospective cohort study using data from Swedish national health registries found a 2 to 3 fold increase in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer in women with rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab compared to biologics-naïve patients or the general population, particularly those over 60 years of age. A causal relationship between infliximab and cervical cancer cannot be excluded. Periodic screening should continue in women treated with Remicade  [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .  Other Malignancies In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blocking agents including Remicade, more malignancies (excluding lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) have been observed in patients receiving those TNF-blockers compared with control patients. During the controlled portions of Remicade trials in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and plaque psoriasis, 14 patients were diagnosed with malignancies (excluding lymphoma and NMSC) among 4019 Remicade-treated patients vs. 1 among 1597 control patients (at a rate of 0.52/100 patient-years among Remicade-treated patients vs. a rate of 0.11/100 patient-years among control patients), with median duration of follow-up 0.5 years for Remicade-treated patients and 0.4 years for control patients. Of these, the most common malignancies were breast, colorectal, and melanoma. The rate of malignancies among Remicade-treated patients was similar to that expected in the general population whereas the rate in control patients was lower than expected. In a clinical trial exploring the use of Remicade in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, the majority of lung or head and neck origin, were reported in Remicade-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Prescribers should exercise caution when considering the use of Remicade in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Psoriasis patients should be monitored for nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), particularly those patients who have had prior prolonged phototherapy treatment. In the maintenance portion of clinical trials for Remicade, NMSCs were more common in patients with previous phototherapy  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The potential role of TNF-blocking therapy in the development of malignancies is not known  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Rates in clinical trials for Remicade cannot be compared to rates in clinical trials of other TNF-blockers and may not predict rates observed in a broader patient population. Caution should be exercised in considering Remicade treatment in patients with a history of malignancy or in continuing treatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving Remicade.  Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Use of TNF blockers, including Remicade, has been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy, including Remicade. For patients who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. Patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, TNF blockers should be stopped and antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, prescribers should exercise caution when considering resumption of TNF blocker therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely.  Hepatotoxicity Severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis and cholestasis, have been reported in postmarketing data in patients receiving Remicade. Autoimmune hepatitis has been diagnosed in some of these cases. Severe hepatic reactions occurred between 2 weeks to more than 1 year after initiation of Remicade; elevations in hepatic aminotransferase levels were not noted prior to discovery of the liver injury in many of these cases. Some of these cases were fatal or necessitated liver transplantation. Patients with symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction should be evaluated for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or marked liver enzyme elevations (e.g., ≥5 times the upper limit of normal) develop, Remicade should be discontinued, and a thorough investigation of the abnormality should be undertaken. In clinical trials, mild or moderate elevations of ALT and AST have been observed in patients receiving Remicade without progression to severe hepatic injury  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  Patients with Heart Failure Remicade has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure, and should be used in patients with heart failure only after consideration of other treatment options. The results of a randomized study evaluating the use of Remicade in patients with heart failure (NYHA Functional Class III/IV) suggested higher mortality in patients who received 10 mg/kg Remicade, and higher rates of cardiovascular adverse events at doses of 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. There have been post-marketing reports of worsening heart failure, with and without identifiable precipitating factors, in patients taking Remicade. There have also been post-marketing reports of new onset heart failure, including heart failure in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age. If a decision is made to administer Remicade to patients with heart failure, they should be closely monitored during therapy, and Remicade should be discontinued if new or worsening symptoms of heart failure appear  [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  Hematologic Reactions Cases of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia, some with a fatal outcome, have been reported in patients receiving Remicade. The causal relationship to Remicade therapy remains unclear. Although no high-risk group(s) has been identified, caution should be exercised in patients being treated with Remicade who have ongoing or a history of significant hematologic abnormalities. All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever) while on Remicade. Discontinuation of Remicade therapy should be considered in patients who develop significant hematologic abnormalities.  Hypersensitivity Remicade has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions that vary in their time of onset and required hospitalization in some cases. Most hypersensitivity reactions, which include anaphylaxis, urticaria, dyspnea, and/or hypotension, have occurred during or within 2 hours of Remicade infusion. However, in some cases, serum sickness-like reactions have been observed in patients after initial Remicade therapy (i.e., as early as after the second dose), and when Remicade therapy was reinstituted following an extended period without Remicade treatment. Symptoms associated with these reactions include fever, rash, headache, sore throat, myalgias, polyarthralgias, hand and facial edema and/or dysphagia. These reactions were associated with a marked increase in antibodies to infliximab, loss of detectable serum concentrations of infliximab, and possible loss of drug efficacy. Remicade should be discontinued for severe hypersensitivity reactions. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., acetaminophen, antihistamines, corticosteroids and/or epinephrine) should be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis clinical trials, re-administration of Remicade after a period of no treatment resulted in a higher incidence of infusion reactions relative to regular maintenance treatment  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In general, the benefit-risk of re-administration of Remicade after a period of no-treatment, especially as a re-induction regimen given at weeks 0, 2 and 6, should be carefully considered. In the case where Remicade maintenance therapy for psoriasis is interrupted, Remicade should be reinitiated as a single dose followed by maintenance therapy.  Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Reactions During and After Infusion ​ Serious cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial ischemia/infarction (some fatal), hypotension, hypertension, and arrhythmias have been reported during and within 24 hours of initiation of Remicade infusion. Cases of transient visual loss have been reported during or within 2 hours of infusion of Remicade. Monitor patients during infusion and if serious reaction occurs, discontinue infusion. Further management of reactions should be dictated by signs and symptoms  [See Adverse Reactions (6) ] .  Neurologic Reactions Remicade and other agents that inhibit TNF have been associated with CNS manifestation of systemic vasculitis, seizure and new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disorders, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Remicade in patients with these neurologic disorders and should consider discontinuation of Remicade if these disorders develop.  Use with Anakinra Serious infections and neutropenia were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNFα-blocking agent, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the nature of the adverse reactions seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNFα-blocking agents. Therefore, the combination of Remicade and anakinra is not recommended.  Use with Abatacept In clinical studies, concurrent administration of TNF-blocking agents and abatacept have been associated with an increased risk of infections including serious infections compared with TNF - blocking agents alone, without increased clinical benefit. Therefore, the combination of Remicade and abatacept is not recommended  [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .  Concurrent Administration with Other Biological Therapeutics There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Remicade with other biological therapeutics used to treat the same conditions as Remicade. The concomitant use of Remicade with these biologics is not recommended because of the possibility of an increased risk of infection  [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] .  Switching Between Biological Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) Care should be taken when switching from one biologic to another, since overlapping biological activity may further increase the risk of infection.  Autoimmunity Treatment with Remicade may result in the formation of autoantibodies and in the development of a lupus-like syndrome. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Remicade, treatment should be discontinued  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  Live Vaccines/Therapeutic Infectious Agents In patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, limited data are available on the response to vaccination with live vaccines or on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines. Use of live vaccines can result in clinical infections, including disseminated infections. The concurrent administration of live vaccines with Remicade is not recommended. Fatal outcome due to disseminated BCG infection has been reported in an infant who received a BCG vaccine after  in utero exposure to infliximab. Infliximab is known to cross the placenta and has been detected up to 6 months following birth. At least a six month waiting period following birth is recommended before the administration of any live vaccine to infants exposed  in utero to infliximab. Other uses of therapeutic infectious agents such as live attenuated bacteria (e.g., BCG bladder instillation for the treatment of cancer) could result in clinical infections, including disseminated infections. It is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with Remicade. It is recommended that all pediatric patients be brought up to date with all vaccinations prior to initiating Remicade therapy. The interval between vaccination and initiation of Remicade therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines.  Adverse Reactions Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  Adverse Reactions in Adults The data described herein reflect exposure to Remicade in 4779 adult patients (1304 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 1106 patients with Crohn's disease, 202 with ankylosing spondylitis, 293 with psoriatic arthritis, 484 with ulcerative colitis, 1373 with plaque psoriasis, and 17 patients with other conditions), including 2625 patients exposed beyond 30 weeks and 374 exposed beyond 1 year.  [For information on adverse reactions in pediatric patients see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] One of the most-common reasons for discontinuation of treatment was infusion-related reactions (e.g., dyspnea, flushing, headache and rash).  Infusion-related Reactions An infusion reaction was defined in clinical trials as any adverse event occurring during an infusion or within 1 hour after an infusion. In Phase 3 clinical studies, 18% of Remicade-treated patients experienced an infusion reaction compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. Of infliximab-treated patients who had an infusion reaction during the induction period, 27% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period. Of patients who did not have an infusion reaction during the induction period, 9% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period. Among all Remicade infusions, 3% were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as fever or chills, 1% were accompanied by cardiopulmonary reactions (primarily chest pain, hypotension, hypertension or dyspnea), and <1% were accompanied by pruritus, urticaria, or the combined symptoms of pruritus/urticaria and cardiopulmonary reactions. Serious infusion reactions occurred in <1% of patients and included anaphylaxis, convulsions, erythematous rash and hypotension. Approximately 3% of patients discontinued Remicade because of infusion reactions, and all patients recovered with treatment and/or discontinuation of the infusion. Remicade infusions beyond the initial infusion were not associated with a higher incidence of reactions. The infusion reaction rates remained stable in psoriasis through 1 year in psoriasis Study I. In psoriasis Study II, the rates were variable over time and somewhat higher following the final infusion than after the initial infusion. Across the 3 psoriasis studies, the percent of total infusions resulting in infusion reactions (i.e., an adverse event occurring within 1 hour) was 7% in the 3 mg/kg group, 4% in the 5 mg/kg group, and 1% in the placebo group. Patients who became positive for antibodies to infliximab were more likely (approximately two-to three-fold) to have an infusion reaction than were those who were negative. Use of concomitant immunosuppressant agents appeared to reduce the frequency of both antibodies to infliximab and infusion reactions  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ] .  Infusion Reactions Following Re-administration In a clinical trial of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis designed to assess the efficacy of long-term maintenance therapy versus re-treatment with an induction regimen of Remicade following disease flare, 4% (8/219) of patients in the re-treatment therapy arm experienced serious infusion reactions versus <1% (1/222) in the maintenance therapy arm. Patients enrolled in this trial did not receive any concomitant immunosuppressant therapy. In this study, the majority of serious infusion reactions occurred during the second infusion at Week 2. Symptoms included, but were not limited to, dyspnea, urticaria, facial edema, and hypotension. In all cases, Remicade treatment was discontinued and/or other treatment instituted with complete resolution of signs and symptoms.  Delayed Reactions/Reactions Following Re-administration In psoriasis studies, approximately 1% of Remicade-treated patients experienced a possible delayed hypersensitivity reaction, generally reported as serum sickness or a combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever and/or rash. These reactions generally occurred within 2 weeks after repeat infusion.  Infections In Remicade clinical studies, treated infections were reported in 36% of Remicade-treated patients (average of 51 weeks of follow-up) and in 25% of placebo-treated patients (average of 37 weeks of follow-up). The infections most frequently reported were respiratory tract infections (including sinusitis, pharyngitis, and bronchitis) and urinary tract infections. Among Remicade-treated patients, serious infections included pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, skin ulceration, sepsis, and bacterial infection. In clinical trials, 7 opportunistic infections were reported; 2 cases each of coccidioidomycosis (1 case was fatal) and histoplasmosis (1 case was fatal), and 1 case each of pneumocystosis, nocardiosis and cytomegalovirus. Tuberculosis was reported in 14 patients, 4 of whom died due to miliary tuberculosis. Other cases of tuberculosis, including disseminated tuberculosis, also have been reported post-marketing. Most of these cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first 2 months after initiation of therapy with Remicade and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the 1-year placebo-controlled studies RA I and RA II, 5.3% of patients receiving Remicade every 8 weeks with MTX developed serious infections as compared to 3.4% of placebo patients receiving MTX. Of 924 patients receiving Remicade, 1.7% developed pneumonia and 0.4% developed TB, when compared to 0.3% and 0.0% in the placebo arm respectively. In a shorter (22-week) placebo-controlled study of 1082 RA patients randomized to receive placebo, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Remicade infusions at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks with MTX, serious infections were more frequent in the 10 mg/kg Remicade group (5.3%) than the 3 mg/kg or placebo groups (1.7% in both). During the 54-week Crohn's II Study, 15% of patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease developed a new fistula-related abscess. In Remicade clinical studies in patients with ulcerative colitis, infections treated with antimicrobials were reported in 27% of Remicade-treated patients (average of 41 weeks of follow-up) and in 18% of placebo-treated patients (average 32 weeks of follow-up). The types of infections, including serious infections, reported in patients with ulcerative colitis were similar to those reported in other clinical studies. The onset of serious infections may be preceded by constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss, and fatigue. The majority of serious infections, however, may also be preceded by signs or symptoms localized to the site of the infection.  Autoantibodies/Lupus-like Syndrome Approximately half of Remicade-treated patients in clinical trials who were antinuclear antibody (ANA) negative at baseline developed a positive ANA during the trial compared with approximately one-fifth of placebo-treated patients. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were newly detected in approximately one-fifth of Remicade-treated patients compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. Reports of lupus and lupus-like syndromes, however, remain uncommon.  Malignancies In controlled trials, more Remicade-treated patients developed malignancies than placebo-treated patients  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In a randomized controlled clinical trial exploring the use of Remicade in patients with moderate to severe COPD who were either current smokers or ex-smokers, 157 patients were treated with Remicade at doses similar to those used in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Of these Remicade-treated patients, 9 developed a malignancy, including 1 lymphoma, for a rate of 7.67 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 3.51 – 14.56). There was 1 reported malignancy among 77 control patients for a rate of 1.63 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 0.04 – 9.10). The majority of the malignancies developed in the lung or head and neck.  Patients with Heart Failure In a randomized study evaluating Remicade in moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%), 150 patients were randomized to receive treatment with 3 infusions of Remicade 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or placebo, at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Higher incidences of mortality and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were observed in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg Remicade dose. At 1 year, 8 patients in the 10 mg/kg Remicade group had died compared with 4 deaths each in the 5 mg/kg Remicade and the placebo groups. There were trends toward increased dyspnea, hypotension, angina, and dizziness in both the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg Remicade treatment groups, versus placebo. Remicade has not been studied in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA Class I/II)  [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] .  Immunogenicity Treatment with Remicade can be associated with the development of antibodies to infliximab. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method was originally used to measure anti-infliximab antibodies in clinical studies of Remicade. The EIA method is subject to interference by serum infliximab, possibly resulting in an underestimation of the rate of patient antibody formation. A separate, drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method for detecting antibodies to infliximab was subsequently developed and validated. This method is 60-fold more sensitive than the original EIA. With the ECLIA method, all clinical samples can be classified as either positive or negative for antibodies to infliximab without the need for the inconclusive category. The incidence of antibodies to infliximab was based on the original EIA method in all clinical studies of Remicade except for the Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis where the incidence of antibodies to infliximab was detected using both the EIA and ECLIA methods  [see Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis (6.1) ] . The incidence of antibodies to infliximab in patients given a 3-dose induction regimen followed by maintenance dosing was approximately 10% as assessed through 1 to 2 years of Remicade treatment. A higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab was observed in Crohn's disease patients receiving Remicade after drug-free intervals >16 weeks. In a study of psoriatic arthritis in which 191 patients received 5 mg/kg with or without MTX, antibodies to infliximab occurred in 15% of patients. The majority of antibody-positive patients had low titers. Patients who were antibody-positive were more likely to have higher rates of clearance, reduced efficacy and to experience an infusion reaction  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] than were patients who were antibody negative. Antibody development was lower among rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease patients receiving immunosuppressant therapies such as 6-MP/AZA or MTX. In the psoriasis Study II, which included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 36% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year, and in 51% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year. In the psoriasis Study III, which also included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 20% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (weeks 0, 2 and 6), and in 27% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg induction. Despite the increase in antibody formation, the infusion reaction rates in Studies I and II in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction followed by every 8 week maintenance for 1 year and in Study III in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (14.1%–23.0%) and serious infusion reaction rates (<1%) were similar to those observed in other study populations. The clinical significance of apparent increased immunogenicity on efficacy and infusion reactions in psoriasis patients as compared to patients with other diseases treated with Remicade over the long term is not known. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to infliximab in an immunoassay, and they are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to infliximab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.  Hepatotoxicity Severe liver injury, including acute liver failure and autoimmune hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving Remicade  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has occurred in patients receiving TNF-blocking agents, including Remicade, who are chronic carriers of this virus  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . In clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis, elevations of aminotransferases were observed (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving Remicade than in controls (Table 1), both when Remicade was given as monotherapy and when it was used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In general, patients who developed ALT and AST elevations were asymptomatic, and the abnormalities decreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of Remicade, or modification of concomitant medications. Table 1: Proportion of patients with elevated ALT in clinical trials  Proportion of patients with elevated ALT >1 to <3 × ULN ≥3 × ULN ≥5 × ULN Placebo Remicade Placebo Remicade Placebo Remicade * Placebo patients received methotrexate while Remicade patients received both Remicade and methotrexate. Median follow-up was 58 weeks.  † Placebo patients in the 2 Phase 3 trials in Crohn's disease received an initial dose of 5 mg/kg Remicade at study start and were on placebo in the maintenance phase. Patients who were randomized to the placebo maintenance group and then later crossed over to Remicade are included in the Remicade group in ALT analysis. Median follow-up was 54 weeks.  ‡ Median follow-up was 30 weeks. Specifically, the median duration of follow-up was 30 weeks for placebo and 31 weeks for Remicade.  § Median follow-up was 24 weeks for the placebo group and 102 weeks for the Remicade group.  ¶ Median follow-up was 39 weeks for the Remicade group and 18 weeks for the placebo group.  # ALT values are obtained in 2 Phase 3 psoriasis studies with median follow-up of 50 weeks for Remicade and 16 weeks for placebo.

Among patients in the 2 Phase 3 studies, 12.4% of patients receiving Remicade 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE in Study I. In Study II, 4.1% and 4.7% of patients receiving Remicade 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, respectively, through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE. One death due to bacterial sepsis occurred 25 days after the second infusion of 5 mg/kg Remicade. Serious infections included sepsis, and abscesses. In Study I, 2.7% of patients receiving Remicade 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. In Study II, 1.0% and 1.3% of patients receiving Remicade 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, through 1 year of treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. The most common serious infection (requiring hospitalization) was abscess (skin, throat, and peri-rectal) reported by 5 (0.7%) patients in the 5 mg/kg Remicade group. Two active cases of tuberculosis were reported: 6 weeks and 34 weeks after starting Remicade. In the placebo-controlled portion of the psoriasis studies, 7 of 1123 patients who received Remicade at any dose were diagnosed with at least one NMSC compared to 0 of 334 patients who received placebo. In the psoriasis studies, 1% (15/1373) of patients experienced serum sickness or a combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever, and/or rash, usually early in the treatment course. Of these patients, 6 required hospitalization due to fever, severe myalgia, arthralgia, swollen joints, and immobility.  Other Adverse Reactions Safety data are available from 4779 Remicade-treated adult patients, including 1304 with rheumatoid arthritis, 1106 with Crohn's disease, 484 with ulcerative colitis, 202 with ankylosing spondylitis, 293 with psoriatic arthritis, 1373 with plaque psoriasis and 17 with other conditions. [For information on other adverse reactions in pediatric patients,  see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving 4 or more infusions are in Table 2. The types and frequencies of adverse reactions observed were similar in Remicade-treated rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and Crohn's disease patients except for abdominal pain, which occurred in 26% of Remicade-treated patients with Crohn's disease. In the Crohn's disease studies, there were insufficient numbers and duration of follow-up for patients who never received Remicade to provide meaningful comparisons.

Other serious, medically relevant adverse reactions ≥0.2% or clinically significant adverse reactions by body system were as follows:  Body as a whole : allergic reaction, edema Blood : pancytopenia Cardiovascular : hypotension Gastrointestinal : constipation, intestinal obstruction Central and Peripheral Nervous : dizziness Heart Rate and Rhythm : bradycardia Liver and Biliary : hepatitis Metabolic and Nutritional : dehydration Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting : thrombocytopenia Neoplasms : lymphoma Red Blood Cell : anemia, hemolytic anemia Resistance Mechanism : cellulitis, sepsis, serum sickness, sarcoidosis Respiratory : lower respiratory tract infection (including pneumonia), pleurisy, pulmonary edema Skin and Appendages : increased sweating Vascular (Extracardiac) : thrombophlebitis White Cell and Reticuloendothelial : leukopenia, lymphadenopathy Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Crohn's Disease There were some differences in the adverse reactions observed in the pediatric patients receiving Remicade compared to those observed in adults with Crohn's disease. These differences are discussed in the following paragraphs. The following adverse reactions were reported more commonly in 103 randomized pediatric Crohn's disease patients administered 5 mg/kg Remicade through 54 weeks than in 385 adult Crohn's disease patients receiving a similar treatment regimen: anemia (11%), leukopenia (9%), flushing (9%), viral infection (8%), neutropenia (7%), bone fracture (7%), bacterial infection (6%), and respiratory tract allergic reaction (6%). Infections were reported in 56% of randomized pediatric patients in Study Peds Crohn's and in 50% of adult patients in Study Crohn's I. In Study Peds Crohn's, infections were reported more frequently for patients who received every 8-week as opposed to every 12-week infusions (74% and 38%, respectively), while serious infections were reported for 3 patients in the every 8-week and 4 patients in the every 12-week maintenance treatment group. The most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, and the most commonly reported serious infection was abscess. Pneumonia was reported for 3 patients, (2 in the every 8-week and 1 in the every 12-week maintenance treatment groups). Herpes zoster was reported for 2 patients in the every 8-week maintenance treatment group. In Study Peds Crohn's, 18% of randomized patients experienced 1 or more infusion reactions, with no notable difference between treatment groups. Of the 112 patients in Study Peds Crohn's, there were no serious infusion reactions, and 2 patients had non-serious anaphylactoid reactions. In Study Peds Crohn's, in which all patients received stable doses of 6-MP, AZA, or MTX, excluding inconclusive samples, 3 of 24 patients had antibodies to infliximab. Although 105 patients were tested for antibodies to infliximab, 81 patients were classified as inconclusive because they could not be ruled as negative due to assay interference by the presence of infliximab in the sample. Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 18% of pediatric patients in Crohn's disease clinical trials; 4% had ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN, and 1% had elevations ≥5 × ULN. (Median follow-up was 53 weeks.)  Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Overall, the adverse reactions reported in the pediatric ulcerative colitis trial and adult ulcerative colitis (Study UC I and Study UC II) studies were generally consistent. In a pediatric UC trial, the most common adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, fever, and headache. Infections were reported in 31 (52%) of 60 treated patients in the pediatric UC trial and 22 (37%) required oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment. The proportion of patients with infections in the pediatric UC trial was similar to that in the pediatric Crohn's disease study (Study Peds Crohn's) but higher than the proportion in the adults' ulcerative colitis studies (Study UC I and Study UC II). The overall incidence of infections in the pediatric UC trial was 13/22 (59%) in the every 8 week maintenance treatment group. Upper respiratory tract infection (7/60 [12%]) and pharyngitis (5/60 [8%]) were the most frequently reported respiratory system infections. Serious infections were reported in 12% (7/60) of all treated patients. In the pediatric UC trial, 58 patients were evaluated for antibodies to infliximab using the EIA as well as the drug-tolerant ECLIA. With the EIA, 4 of 58 (7%) patients had antibodies to infliximab. With the ECLIA, 30 of 58 (52%) patients had antibodies to infliximab  [see Adverse Reactions, Immunogenicity (6.1) ] . The higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab by the ECLIA method was due to the 60-fold higher sensitivity compared to the EIA method. While EIA-positive patients generally had undetectable trough infliximab concentrations, ECLIA-positive patients could have detectable trough concentrations of infliximab because the ECLIA assay is more sensitive and drug-tolerant. Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 17% (10/60) of pediatric patients in the pediatric UC trial; 7% (4/60) had ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN, and 2% (1/60) had elevations ≥5 × ULN (median follow-up was 49 weeks). Overall, 8 of 60 (13%) treated patients experienced one or more infusion reactions, including 4 of 22 (18%) patients in the every 8-week treatment maintenance group. No serious infusion reactions were reported. In the pediatric UC trial, 45 patients were in the 12 to 17 year age group and 15 in the 6 to 11 year age group. The numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to make any definitive conclusions about the effect of age on safety events. There were higher proportions of patients with serious adverse events (40% vs. 18%) and discontinuation due to adverse events (40% vs. 16%) in the younger age group than in the older age group. While the proportion of patients with infections was also higher in the younger age group (60% vs. 49%), for serious infections, the proportions were similar in the two age groups (13% in the 6 to 11 year age group vs. 11% in the 12 to 17 year age group). Overall proportions of adverse reactions, including infusion reactions, were similar between the 6 to 11 and 12 to 17 year age groups (13%).  Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Remicade in adult and pediatric patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, have been reported during post-approval use of Remicade: neutropenia  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] , agranulocytosis (including infants exposed  in utero to infliximab), interstitial lung disease (including pulmonary fibrosis/interstitial pneumonitis and rapidly progressive disease), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, pericardial effusion, systemic and cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, peripheral demyelinating disorders (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy), new onset and worsening psoriasis (all subtypes including pustular, primarily palmoplantar), transverse myelitis, and neuropathies (additional neurologic reactions have also been observed)  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] , acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis, and cholestasis  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] , serious infections  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , malignancies, including leukemia, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] and vaccine breakthrough infection including bovine tuberculosis (disseminated BCG infection) following vaccination in an infant exposed  in utero to infliximab  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] .  Infusion-related Reactions In post-marketing experience, cases of anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, laryngeal/pharyngeal edema and severe bronchospasm, and seizure have been associated with Remicade administration. Cases of transient visual loss have been reported in association with Remicade during or within 2 hours of infusion. Cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial ischemia/infarction (some fatal), and arrhythmia occurring within 24 hours of initiation of infusion have also been reported  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] .  Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients The following serious adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience in children: infections (some fatal) including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, infusion reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions. Serious adverse reactions in the post-marketing experience with Remicade in the pediatric population have also included malignancies, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas  [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] , transient hepatic enzyme abnormalities, lupus-like syndromes, and the development of autoantibodies.  Drug Interactions Use with Anakinra or Abatacept An increased risk of serious infections was seen in clinical studies of other TNFα-blocking agents used in combination with anakinra or abatacept, with no added clinical benefit. Because of the nature of the adverse reactions seen with these combinations with TNF-blocker therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra or abatacept with other TNFα-blocking agents. Therefore, the combination of Remicade and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10 and 5.11) ] .  Use with Tocilizumab The use of tocilizumab in combination with biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists, including Remicade, should be avoided because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.  Use with Other Biological Therapeutics The combination of Remicade with other biological therapeutics used to treat the same conditions as Remicade is not recommended  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] .  Methotrexate (MTX) and Other Concomitant Medications Specific drug interaction studies, including interactions with MTX, have not been conducted. The majority of patients in rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease clinical studies received one or more concomitant medications. In rheumatoid arthritis, concomitant medications besides MTX were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), folic acid, corticosteroids and/or narcotics. Concomitant Crohn's disease medications were antibiotics, antivirals, corticosteroids, 6-MP/AZA and aminosalicylates. In psoriatic arthritis clinical trials, concomitant medications included MTX in approximately half of the patients as well as NSAIDs, folic acid and corticosteroids. Concomitant MTX use may decrease the incidence of anti-infliximab antibody production and increase infliximab concentrations.  Immunosuppressants Patients with Crohn's disease who received immunosuppressants tended to experience fewer infusion reactions compared to patients on no immunosuppressants  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Serum infliximab concentrations appeared to be unaffected by baseline use of medications for the treatment of Crohn's disease including corticosteroids, antibiotics (metronidazole or ciprofloxacin) and aminosalicylates.  Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Therefore, it is expected that for a molecule that antagonizes cytokine activity, such as infliximab, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Remicade in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed.  Live Vaccines/Therapeutic Infectious Agents It is recommended that live vaccines not be given concurrently with Remicade. It is also recommended that live vaccines not be given to infants after  in utero exposure to infliximab for at least 6 months following birth  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . It is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with Remicade  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] .  USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B . It is not known whether Remicade can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Remicade should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Because infliximab does not cross-react with TNFα in species other than humans and chimpanzees, animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Remicade. No evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed in a developmental toxicity study conducted in mice using an analogous antibody that selectively inhibits the functional activity of mouse TNFα. Doses of 10 to 15 mg/kg in pharmacodynamic animal models with the anti-TNF analogous antibody produced maximal pharmacologic effectiveness. Doses up to 40 mg/kg were shown to produce no adverse effects in animal reproduction studies. As with other IgG antibodies, infliximab crosses the placenta. Infliximab has been detected in the serum of infants up to 6 months following birth. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk of infection, including disseminated infection which can become fatal. At least a six month waiting period following birth is recommended before the administration of live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine or other live vaccines, such as the rotavirus vaccine) to these infants  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Cases of agranulocytosis in infants exposed  in utero have also been reported  [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .  Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Remicade is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. Because many drugs and immunoglobulins are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from Remicade, women should not breastfeed their infants while taking Remicade. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.  Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Remicade have been established in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age for induction and maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. However, Remicade has not been studied in children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis <6 years of age.  Pediatric Crohn's Disease Remicade is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in pediatric patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy  [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5) , Indications and Usage (1.2) , Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Studies (14.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Remicade has been studied only in combination with conventional immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease. The longer term (greater than 1 year) safety and effectiveness of Remicade in pediatric Crohn's disease patients have not been established in clinical trials.  Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis The safety and effectiveness of Remicade for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy are supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Remicade in adults. Additional safety and pharmacokinetic data were collected in 60 pediatric patients aged 6 years and older  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The effectiveness of Remicade in inducing and maintaining mucosal healing could not be established. Although 41 patients had a Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 at the Week 8 endoscopy, the induction phase was open-label and lacked a control group. Only 9 patients had an optional endoscopy at Week 54. In the pediatric UC trial, approximately half of the patients were on concomitant immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX) at study start. Due to the risk of HSTCL, a careful risk-benefit assessment should be made when Remicade is used in combination with other immunosuppressants. The longer term (greater than 1 year) safety and effectiveness of Remicade in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients have not been established in clinical trials.  Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) The safety and efficacy of Remicade in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study for 14 weeks, followed by a double-blind, all-active treatment extension, for a maximum of 44 weeks. Patients with active JRA between the ages of 4 and 17 years who had been treated with MTX for at least 3 months were enrolled. Concurrent use of folic acid, oral corticosteroids (≤0.2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent), NSAIDs, and/or disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) was permitted. Doses of 3 mg/kg Remicade or placebo were administered intravenously at Weeks 0, 2 and 6. Patients randomized to placebo crossed-over to receive 6 mg/kg Remicade at Weeks 14, 16, and 20, and then every 8 weeks through Week 44. Patients who completed the study continued to receive open-label treatment with Remicade for up to 2 years in a companion extension study. The study failed to establish the efficacy of Remicade in the treatment of JRA. Key observations in the study included a high placebo response rate and a higher rate of immunogenicity than what has been observed in adults. Additionally, a higher rate of clearance of infliximab was observed than had been observed in adults  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . A total of 60 patients with JRA were treated with doses of 3 mg/kg and 57 patients were treated with doses of 6 mg/kg. The proportion of patients with infusion reactions who received 3 mg/kg Remicade was 35% (21/60) over 52 weeks compared with 18% (10/57) in patients who received 6 mg/kg over 38 weeks. The most common infusion reactions reported were vomiting, fever, headache, and hypotension. In the 3 mg/kg Remicade group, 4 patients had a serious infusion reaction and 3 patients reported a possible anaphylactic reaction (2 of which were among the serious infusion reactions). In the 6 mg/kg Remicade group, 2 patients had a serious infusion reaction, 1 of whom had a possible anaphylactic reaction. Two of the 6 patients who experienced serious infusion reactions received Remicade by rapid infusion (duration of less than 2 hours). Antibodies to infliximab developed in 38% (20/53) of patients who received 3 mg/kg Remicade compared with 12% (6/49) of patients who received 6 mg/kg. A total of 68% (41/60) of patients who received 3 mg/kg Remicade in combination with MTX experienced an infection over 52 weeks compared with 65% (37/57) of patients who received 6 mg/kg Remicade in combination with MTX over 38 weeks. The most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, and the most commonly reported serious infection was pneumonia. Other notable infections included primary varicella infection in 1 patient and herpes zoster in 1 patient.  Geriatric Use In rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis clinical trials, no overall differences were observed in effectiveness or safety in 181 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 75 patients with plaque psoriasis, aged 65 or older who received Remicade, compared to younger patients-although the incidence of serious adverse reactions in patients aged 65 or older was higher in both Remicade and control groups compared to younger patients. In Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis studies, there were insufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from patients aged 18 to 65. There is a greater incidence of infections in the elderly population in general. The incidence of serious infections in Remicade-treated patients 65 years and older was greater than in those under 65 years of age; therefore caution should be used in treating the elderly  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  Overdosage Single doses up to 20 mg/kg have been administered without any direct toxic effect. In case of overdosage, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.  Remicade Description Infliximab, the active ingredient in Remicade, is a chimeric IgG1κ monoclonal antibody (composed of human constant and murine variable regions) specific for human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). It has a molecular weight of approximately 149.1 kilodaltons. Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous perfusion and is purified by a series of steps that includes measures to inactivate and remove viruses. Remicade is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized powder for intravenous infusion. Following reconstitution with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the resulting pH is approximately 7.2. Each single-dose vial contains 100 mg infliximab, dibasic sodium phosphate, dihydrate (6.1 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate, monohydrate (2.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.5 mg), and sucrose (500 mg). No preservatives are present.  Remicade - Clinical Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Infliximab neutralizes the biological activity of TNFα by binding with high affinity to the soluble and transmembrane forms of TNFα and inhibits binding of TNFα with its receptors. Infliximab does not neutralize TNFβ (lymphotoxin-α), a related cytokine that utilizes the same receptors as TNFα. Biological activities attributed to TNFα include: induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL) 1 and 6, enhancement of leukocyte migration by increasing endothelial layer permeability and expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells and leukocytes, activation of neutrophil and eosinophil functional activity, induction of acute phase reactants and other liver proteins, as well as tissue degrading enzymes produced by synoviocytes and/or chondrocytes. Cells expressing transmembrane TNFα bound by infliximab can be lysed  in vitro or  in vivo . Infliximab inhibits the functional activity of TNFα in a wide variety of  in vitro bioassays utilizing human fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neutrophils, B and T-lymphocytes and epithelial cells. The relationship of these biological response markers to the mechanism(s) by which Remicade exerts its clinical effects is unknown. Anti-TNFα antibodies reduce disease activity in the cotton-top tamarin colitis model, and decrease synovitis and joint erosions in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis. Infliximab prevents disease in transgenic mice that develop polyarthritis as a result of constitutive expression of human TNFα, and when administered after disease onset, allows eroded joints to heal.  Pharmacodynamics Elevated concentrations of TNFα have been found in involved tissues and fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. In rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with Remicade reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells into inflamed areas of the joint as well as expression of molecules mediating cellular adhesion [E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)], chemoattraction [IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1)] and tissue degradation [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and 3]. In Crohn's disease, treatment with Remicade reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells and TNFα production in inflamed areas of the intestine, and reduced the proportion of mononuclear cells from the lamina propria able to express TNFα and interferon. After treatment with Remicade, patients with rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease exhibited decreased levels of serum IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to baseline. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from Remicade-treated patients showed no significant decrease in number or in proliferative responses to  in vitro mitogenic stimulation when compared to cells from untreated patients. In psoriatic arthritis, treatment with Remicade resulted in a reduction in the number of T-cells and blood vessels in the synovium and psoriatic skin lesions as well as a reduction of macrophages in the synovium. In plaque psoriasis, Remicade treatment may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which Remicade exerts its clinical effects is unknown.  Pharmacokinetics In adults, single intravenous (IV) infusions of 3 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg showed a linear relationship between the dose administered and the maximum serum concentration. The volume of distribution at steady state was independent of dose and indicated that infliximab was distributed primarily within the vascular compartment. Pharmacokinetic results for single doses of 3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg in rheumatoid arthritis, 5 mg/kg in Crohn's disease, and 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg in plaque psoriasis indicate that the median terminal half-life of infliximab is 7.7 to 9.5 days. Following an initial dose of Remicade, repeated infusions at 2 and 6 weeks resulted in predictable concentration-time profiles following each treatment. No systemic accumulation of infliximab occurred upon continued repeated treatment with 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg at 4- or 8-week intervals. Development of antibodies to infliximab increased infliximab clearance. At 8 weeks after a maintenance dose of 3 to 10 mg/kg of Remicade, median infliximab serum concentrations ranged from approximately 0.5 to 6 mcg/mL; however, infliximab concentrations were not detectable (<0.1 mcg/mL) in patients who became positive for antibodies to infliximab. No major differences in clearance or volume of distribution were observed in patient subgroups defined by age, weight, or gender. It is not known if there are differences in clearance or volume of distribution in patients with marked impairment of hepatic or renal function. Infliximab pharmacokinetic characteristics (including peak and trough concentrations and terminal half-life) were similar in pediatric (aged 6 to 17 years) and adult patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis following the administration of 5 mg/kg infliximab. Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) with a body weight of up to 35 kg receiving 6 mg/kg Remicade and children with JRA with body weight greater than 35 kg up to adult body weight receiving 3 mg/kg Remicade, the steady state area under the concentration curve (AUC  ss ) was similar to that observed in adults receiving 3 mg/kg of Remicade.  Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The significance of the results of nonclinical studies for human risk is unknown. A repeat dose toxicity study was conducted with mice given cV1q anti-mouse TNFα to evaluate tumorigenicity. CV1q is an analogous antibody that inhibits the function of TNFα in mice. Animals were assigned to 1 of 3 dose groups: control, 10 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg cV1q given weekly for 6 months. The weekly doses of 10 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg are 2 and 8 times, respectively, the human dose of 5 mg/kg for Crohn's disease. Results indicated that cV1q did not cause tumorigenicity in mice. No clastogenic or mutagenic effects of infliximab were observed in the  in vivo mouse micronucleus test or the  Salmonella-Escherichia coli (Ames) assay, respectively. Chromosomal aberrations were not observed in an assay performed using human lymphocytes. It is not known whether infliximab can impair fertility in humans. No impairment of fertility was observed in a fertility and general reproduction toxicity study with the analogous mouse antibody used in the 6-month chronic toxicity study.  Clinical Studies Crohn's Disease Active Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of single and multiple doses of Remicade were assessed in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in 653 patients with moderate to severely active Crohn's disease [Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥220 and ≤400] with an inadequate response to prior conventional therapies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 92% of patients continued to receive at least one of these medications. In the single-dose trial of 108 patients, 16% (4/25) of placebo patients achieved a clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥70 points) at Week 4 vs. 81% (22/27) of patients receiving 5 mg/kg Remicade (p<0.001, two-sided, Fisher's Exact test). Additionally, 4% (1/25) of placebo patients and 48% (13/27) of patients receiving 5 mg/kg Remicade achieved clinical remission (CDAI<150) at Week 4. In a multidose trial (ACCENT I [Study Crohn's I]), 545 patients received 5 mg/kg at Week 0 and were then randomized to one of three treatment groups; the placebo maintenance group received placebo at Weeks 2 and 6, and then every 8 weeks; the 5 mg/kg maintenance group received 5 mg/kg at Weeks 2 and 6, and then every 8 weeks; and the 10 mg/kg maintenance group received 5 mg/kg at Weeks 2 and 6, and then 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Patients in response at Week 2 were randomized and analyzed separately from those not in response at Week 2. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after Week 6. At Week 2, 57% (311/545) of patients were in clinical response. At Week 30, a significantly greater proportion of these patients in the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg maintenance groups achieved clinical remission compared to patients in the placebo maintenance group (Table 3). Additionally, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Remicade maintenance groups were in clinical remission and were able to discontinue corticosteroid use compared to patients in the placebo maintenance group at Week 54 (Table 3). Table 3: Clinical remission and steroid withdrawal  Single 5-mg/kg Dose * Three-Dose Induction † Placebo Maintenance Remicade Maintenance q8 wks 5 mg/kg 10 mg/kg * Remicade at Week 0  † Remicade 5 mg/kg administered at Weeks 0, 2 and 6  ‡ P -values represent pairwise comparisons to placebo  § Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline Week 30  25/102 41/104 48/105 Clinical remission 25% 39% 46% P -value ‡ 0.022 0.001 Week 54  6/54 14/56 18/53 Patients in remission able to discontinue corticosteroid use § 11% 25% 34% P -value ‡ 0.059 0.005 Patients in the Remicade maintenance groups (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) had a longer time to loss of response than patients in the placebo maintenance group (Figure 1). At Weeks 30 and 54, significant improvement from baseline was seen among the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Remicade-treated groups compared to the placebo group in the disease-specific inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ), particularly the bowel and systemic components, and in the physical component summary score of the general health-related quality of life questionnaire SF-36. Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier estimate of the proportion of patients who had not lost response through Week 54   In a subset of 78 patients who had mucosal ulceration at baseline and who participated in an endoscopic substudy, 13 of 43 patients in the Remicade maintenance group had endoscopic evidence of mucosal healing compared to 1 of 28 patients in the placebo group at Week 10. Of the Remicade-treated patients showing mucosal healing at Week 10, 9 of 12 patients also showed mucosal healing at Week 54. Patients who achieved a response and subsequently lost response were eligible to receive Remicade on an episodic basis at a dose that was 5 mg/kg higher than the dose to which they were randomized. The majority of such patients responded to the higher dose. Among patients who were not in response at Week 2, 59% (92/157) of Remicade maintenance patients responded by Week 14 compared to 51% (39/77) of placebo maintenance patients. Among patients who did not respond by Week 14, additional therapy did not result in significantly more responses  [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] .  Fistulizing Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of Remicade were assessed in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease with fistula(s) that were of at least 3 months duration. Concurrent use of stable doses of corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylates, antibiotics, MTX, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and/or azathioprine (AZA) was permitted. In the first trial, 94 patients received 3 doses of either placebo or Remicade at Weeks 0, 2 and 6. Fistula response (≥50% reduction in number of enterocutaneous fistulas draining upon gentle compression on at least 2 consecutive visits without an increase in medication or surgery for Crohn's disease) was seen in 68% (21/31) of patients in the 5 mg/kg Remicade group (  P =0.002) and 56% (18/32) of patients in the 10 mg/kg Remicade group (  P =0.021) vs. 26% (8/31) of patients in the placebo arm. The median time to onset of response and median duration of response in Remicade-treated patients was 2 and 12 weeks, respectively. Closure of all fistulas was achieved in 52% of Remicade-treated patients compared with 13% of placebo-treated patients (  P <0.001). In the second trial (ACCENT II [Study Crohn's II]), patients who were enrolled had to have at least 1 draining enterocutaneous (perianal, abdominal) fistula. All patients received 5 mg/kg Remicade at Weeks 0, 2 and 6. Patients were randomized to placebo or 5 mg/kg Remicade maintenance at Week 14. Patients received maintenance doses at Week 14 and then every 8 weeks through Week 46. Patients who were in fistula response (fistula response was defined the same as in the first trial) at both Weeks 10 and 14 were randomized separately from those not in response. The primary endpoint was time from randomization to loss of response among those patients who were in fistula response. Among the randomized patients (273 of the 296 initially enrolled), 87% had perianal fistulas and 14% had abdominal fistulas. Eight percent also had rectovaginal fistulas. Greater than 90% of the patients had received previous immunosuppressive and antibiotic therapy. At Week 14, 65% (177/273) of patients were in fistula response. Patients randomized to Remicade maintenance had a longer time to loss of fistula response compared to the placebo maintenance group (Figure 2). At Week 54, 38% (33/87) of Remicade-treated patients had no draining fistulas compared with 22% (20/90) of placebo-treated patients (  P =0.02). Compared to placebo maintenance, patients on Remicade maintenance had a trend toward fewer hospitalizations. Figure 2: Life table estimates of the proportion of patients who had not lost fistula response through Week 54   Patients who achieved a fistula response and subsequently lost response were eligible to receive Remicade maintenance therapy at a dose that was 5 mg/kg higher than the dose to which they were randomized. Of the placebo maintenance patients, 66% (25/38) responded to 5 mg/kg Remicade, and 57% (12/21) of Remicade maintenance patients responded to 10 mg/kg. Patients who had not achieved a response by Week 14 were unlikely to respond to additional doses of Remicade. Similar proportions of patients in either group developed new fistulas (17% overall) and similar numbers developed abscesses (15% overall).  Pediatric Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of Remicade were assessed in a randomized, open-label study (Study Peds Crohn's) in 112 pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years old with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and an inadequate response to conventional therapies. The median age was 13 years and the median Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) was 40 (on a scale of 0 to 100). All patients were required to be on a stable dose of 6-MP, AZA, or MTX; 35% were also receiving corticosteroids at baseline. All patients received induction dosing of 5 mg/kg Remicade at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. At Week 10, 103 patients were randomized to a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg Remicade given either every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks. At Week 10, 88% of patients were in clinical response (defined as a decrease from baseline in the PCDAI score of ≥15 points and total PCDAI score of ≤30 points), and 59% were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI score of ≤10 points). The proportion of pediatric patients achieving clinical response at Week 10 compared favorably with the proportion of adults achieving a clinical response in Study Crohn's I. The study definition of clinical response in Study Peds Crohn's was based on the PCDAI score, whereas the CDAI score was used in the adult Study Crohn's I. At both Week 30 and Week 54, the proportion of patients in clinical response was greater in the every 8-week treatment group than in the every 12-week treatment group (73% vs. 47% at Week 30, and 64% vs. 33% at Week 54). At both Week 30 and Week 54, the proportion of patients in clinical remission was also greater in the every 8-week treatment group than in the every 12-week treatment group (60% vs. 35% at Week 30, and 56% vs. 24% at Week 54), (Table 4). For patients in Study Peds Crohn's receiving corticosteroids at baseline, the proportion of patients able to discontinue corticosteroids while in remission at Week 30 was 46% for the every 8-week maintenance group and 33% for the every 12-week maintenance group. At Week 54, the proportion of patients able to discontinue corticosteroids while in remission was 46% for the every 8-week maintenance group and 17% for the every 12-week maintenance group.

Concomitant treatment with stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and/or immunomodulatory agents was permitted. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after Week 8. Patients were randomized at week 0 to receive either placebo, 5 mg/kg Remicade or 10 mg/kg Remicade at Weeks 0, 2, 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 46 in Study UC I, and at Weeks 0, 2, 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 22 in Study UC II. In Study UC II, patients were allowed to continue blinded therapy to Week 46 at the investigator's discretion. Patients in Study UC I had failed to respond or were intolerant to oral corticosteroids, 6-MP, or AZA. Patients in Study UC II had failed to respond or were intolerant to the above treatments and/or aminosalicylates. Similar proportions of patients in Studies UC I and UC II were receiving corticosteroids (61% and 51%, respectively), 6-MP/AZA (49% and 43%) and aminosalicylates (70% and 75%) at baseline. More patients in Study UC II than UC I were taking solely aminosalicylates for UC (26% vs. 11%, respectively). Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score by ≥30% and ≥3 points, accompanied by a decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1.  Clinical Response, Clinical Remission, and Mucosal Healing In both Study UC I and Study UC II, greater percentages of patients in both Remicade groups achieved clinical response, clinical remission and mucosal healing than in the placebo group. Each of these effects was maintained through the end of each trial (Week 54 in Study UC I, and Week 30 in Study UC II). In addition, a greater proportion of patients in Remicade groups demonstrated sustained response and sustained remission than in the placebo groups (Table 5). Of patients on corticosteroids at baseline, greater proportions of patients in the Remicade treatment groups were in clinical remission and able to discontinue corticosteroids at Week 30 compared with the patients in the placebo treatment groups (22% in Remicade treatment groups vs. 10% in placebo group in Study UC I; 23% in Remicade treatment groups vs. 3% in placebo group in Study UC II). In Study UC I, this effect was maintained through Week 54 (21% in Remicade treatment groups vs. 9% in placebo group). The Remicade-associated response was generally similar in the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose groups.

Additional safety and pharmacokinetic data were collected in an open-label pediatric UC trial in 60 pediatric patients aged 6 through 17 years (median age 14.5 years) with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score of 6 to 12; Endoscopic subscore ≥2) and an inadequate response to conventional therapies. At baseline, the median Mayo score was 8, 53% of patients were receiving immunomodulator therapy (6-MP/AZA/MTX), and 62% of patients were receiving corticosteroids (median dose 0.5 mg/kg/day in prednisone equivalents). Discontinuation of immunomodulators and corticosteroid taper were permitted after Week 0. All patients received induction dosing of 5 mg/kg Remicade at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. Patients who did not respond to Remicade at Week 8 received no further Remicade and returned for safety follow-up. At Week 8, 45 patients were randomized to a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg Remicade given either every 8 weeks through Week 46 or every 12 weeks through Week 42. Patients were allowed to change to a higher dose and/or more frequent administration schedule if they experienced loss of response. Clinical response at Week 8 was defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score by ≥30% and ≥3 points, including a decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore by ≥1 points or achievement of a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Clinical remission at Week 8 was measured by the Mayo score, defined as a Mayo score of ≤2 points with no individual subscore >1. Clinical remission was also assessed at Week 8 and Week 54 using the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI)  6 score and was defined by a PUCAI score of <10 points. Endoscopies were performed at baseline and at Week 8. A Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 indicated normal or inactive disease and a subscore of 1 indicated mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, or mild friability). Of the 60 patients treated, 44 were in clinical response at Week 8. Of 32 patients taking concomitant immunomodulators at baseline, 23 achieved clinical response at Week 8, compared to 21 of 28 of those not taking concomitant immunomodulators at baseline. At Week 8, 24 of 60 patients were in clinical remission as measured by the Mayo score and 17 of 51 patients were in remission as measured by the PUCAI score. At Week 54, 8 of 21 patients in the every 8-week maintenance group and 4 of 22 patients in the every 12-week maintenance group achieved remission as measured by the PUCAI score. During maintenance phase, 23 of 45 randomized patients (9 in the every 8-week group and 14 in the every 12-week group) required an increase in their dose and/or increase in frequency of Remicade administration due to loss of response. Nine of the 23 patients who required a change in dose had achieved remission at Week 54. Seven of those patients received the 10 mg/kg every 8-week dosing.  Rheumatoid Arthritis The safety and efficacy of Remicade were assessed in 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, pivotal trials: ATTRACT (Study RA I) and ASPIRE (Study RA II). Concurrent use of stable doses of folic acid, oral corticosteroids (≤10 mg/day) and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was permitted. Study RA I was a placebo-controlled study of 428 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with MTX. Patients enrolled had a median age of 54 years, median disease duration of 8.4 years, median swollen and tender joint count of 20 and 31 respectively, and were on a median dose of 15 mg/wk of MTX. Patients received either placebo + MTX or one of 4 doses/schedules of Remicade + MTX: 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of Remicade by IV infusion at Weeks 0, 2 and 6 followed by additional infusions every 4 or 8 weeks in combination with MTX. Study RA II was a placebo-controlled study of 3 active treatment arms in 1004 MTX naive patients of 3 or fewer years' duration active rheumatoid arthritis. Patients enrolled had a median age of 51 years with a median disease duration of 0.6 years, median swollen and tender joint count of 19 and 31, respectively, and >80% of patients had baseline joint erosions. At randomization, all patients received MTX (optimized to 20 mg/wk by Week 8) and either placebo, 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg Remicade at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter. Data on use of Remicade without concurrent MTX are limited  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  Clinical Response In Study RA I, all doses/schedules of Remicade + MTX resulted in improvement in signs and symptoms as measured by the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR 20) with a higher percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50 and 70 compared to placebo + MTX (Table 7). This improvement was observed at Week 2 and maintained through Week 102. Greater effects on each component of the ACR 20 were observed in all patients treated with Remicade + MTX compared to placebo + MTX (Table 8). More patients treated with Remicade reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients (Table 7). In Study RA II, after 54 weeks of treatment, both doses of Remicade + MTX resulted in statistically significantly greater response in signs and symptoms compared to MTX alone as measured by the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses (Table 7). More patients treated with Remicade reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients (Table 7).

The inhibition of progression of structural damage was observed at 54 weeks (Table 9) and maintained through 102 weeks. In Study RA II, >90% of patients had at least 2 evaluable X-rays. Inhibition of progression of structural damage was observed at Weeks 30 and 54 (Table 9) in the Remicade + MTX groups compared to MTX alone. Patients treated with Remicade + MTX demonstrated less progression of structural damage compared to MTX alone, whether baseline acute-phase reactants (ESR and CRP) were normal or elevated: patients with elevated baseline acute-phase reactants treated with MTX alone demonstrated a mean progression in vdH-S score of 4.2 units compared to patients treated with Remicade + MTX who demonstrated 0.5 units of progression; patients with normal baseline acute phase reactants treated with MTX alone demonstrated a mean progression in vdH-S score of 1.8 units compared to Remicade + MTX who demonstrated 0.2 units of progression. Of patients receiving Remicade + MTX, 59% had no progression (vdH-S score ≤0 unit) of structural damage compared to 45% of patients receiving MTX alone. In a subset of patients who began the study without erosions, Remicade + MTX maintained an erosion-free state at 1 year in a greater proportion of patients than MTX alone, 79% (77/98) vs. 58% (23/40), respectively (  P <0.01). Fewer patients in the Remicade + MTX groups (47%) developed erosions in uninvolved joints compared to MTX alone (59%).

In Study RA I, all doses/schedules of Remicade + MTX showed significantly greater improvement from baseline in HAQ-DI and SF-36 physical component summary score averaged over time through Week 54 compared to placebo + MTX, and no worsening in the SF-36 mental component summary score. The median (interquartile range) improvement from baseline to Week 54 in HAQ-DI was 0.1 (-0.1, 0.5) for the placebo + MTX group and 0.4 (0.1, 0.9) for Remicade + MTX (p<0.001). Both HAQ-DI and SF-36 effects were maintained through Week 102. Approximately 80% of patients in all doses/schedules of Remicade + MTX remained in the trial through 102 weeks. In Study RA II, both Remicade treatment groups showed greater improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline averaged over time through Week 54 compared to MTX alone; 0.7 for Remicade + MTX vs. 0.6 for MTX alone (  P ≤0.001). No worsening in the SF-36 mental component summary score was observed.  Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of Remicade were assessed in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 279 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. Patients were between 18 and 74 years of age, and had ankylosing spondylitis as defined by the modified New York criteria for Ankylosing Spondylitis.  4 Patients were to have had active disease as evidenced by both a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score >4 (possible range 0–10) and spinal pain >4 (on a Visual Analog Scale [VAS] of 0–10). Patients with complete ankylosis of the spine were excluded from study participation, and the use of Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) and systemic corticosteroids were prohibited. Doses of Remicade 5 mg/kg or placebo were administered intravenously at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 12 and 18. At 24 weeks, improvement in the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, as measured by the proportion of patients achieving a 20% improvement in ASAS response criteria (ASAS 20), was seen in 60% of patients in the Remicade-treated group vs. 18% of patients in the placebo group (p<0.001). Improvement was observed at Week 2 and maintained through Week 24 (Figure 3 and Table 10). Figure 3: Proportion of patients achieving ASAS 20 response   At 24 weeks, the proportions of patients achieving a 50% and a 70% improvement in the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, as measured by ASAS response criteria (ASAS 50 and ASAS 70, respectively), were 44% and 28%, respectively, for patients receiving Remicade, compared to 9% and 4%, respectively, for patients receiving placebo (  P <0.001, Remicade vs. placebo). A low level of disease activity (defined as a value <20 [on a scale of 0–100 mm] in each of the 4 ASAS response parameters) was achieved in 22% of Remicade-treated patients vs. 1% in placebo-treated patients (  P <0.001).

There was no change in the SF-36 mental component summary score in either the Remicade group or the placebo group. Results of this study were similar to those seen in a multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 70 patients with ankylosing spondylitis.  Psoriatic Arthritis Safety and efficacy of Remicade were assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 200 adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis despite DMARD or NSAID therapy (≥5 swollen joints and ≥5 tender joints) with 1 or more of the following subtypes: arthritis involving DIP joints (n=49), arthritis mutilans (n=3), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (n=40), polyarticular arthritis (n=100), and spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (n=8). Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion ≥2 cm in diameter. Forty-six percent of patients continued on stable doses of methotrexate (≤25 mg/week). During the 24-week double-blind phase, patients received either 5 mg/kg Remicade or placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22 (100 patients in each group). At Week 16, placebo patients with <10% improvement from baseline in both swollen and tender joint counts were switched to Remicade induction (early escape). At Week 24, all placebo-treated patients crossed over to Remicade induction. Dosing continued for all patients through Week 46.  Clinical Response Treatment with Remicade resulted in improvement in signs and symptoms, as assessed by the ACR criteria, with 58% of Remicade-treated patients achieving ACR 20 at Week 14, compared with 11% of placebo-treated patients (  P <0.001). The response was similar regardless of concomitant use of methotrexate. Improvement was observed as early as Week 2. At 6 months, the ACR 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 54%, 41%, and 27%, respectively, of patients receiving Remicade compared to 16%, 4%, and 2%, respectively, of patients receiving placebo. Similar responses were seen in patients with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few patients were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and spondylitis with peripheral arthritis subtypes. Compared to placebo, treatment with Remicade resulted in improvements in the components of the ACR response criteria, as well as in dactylitis and enthesopathy (Table 11). The clinical response was maintained through Week 54. Similar ACR responses were observed in an earlier randomized, placebo-controlled study of 104 psoriatic arthritis patients, and the responses were maintained through 98 weeks in an open-label extension phase.

At 6 months, the PASI 75 and PASI 90 responses were achieved by 60% and 39%, respectively, of patients receiving Remicade compared to 1% and 0%, respectively, of patients receiving placebo. The PASI response was generally maintained through Week 54.  [see Clinical Studies (14.8) ] .  Radiographic Response Structural damage in both hands and feet was assessed radiographically by the change from baseline in the van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score, modified by the addition of hand DIP joints. The total modified vdH-S score is a composite score of structural damage that measures the number and size of joint erosions and the degree of joint space narrowing (JSN) in the hands and feet. At Week 24, Remicade-treated patients had less radiographic progression than placebo-treated patients (mean change of -0.70 vs. 0.82,  P <0.001). Remicade-treated patients also had less progression in their erosion scores (-0.56 vs 0.51) and JSN scores (-0.14 vs 0.31). The patients in the Remicade group demonstrated continued inhibition of structural damage at Week 54. Most patients showed little or no change in the vdH-S score during this 12-month study (median change of 0 in both patients who initially received Remicade or placebo). More patients in the placebo group (12%) had readily apparent radiographic progression compared with the Remicade group (3%).  Physical Function Physical function status was assessed using the HAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and the SF-36 Health Survey. Remicade-treated patients demonstrated significant improvement in physical function as assessed by HAQ-DI (median percent improvement in HAQ-DI score from baseline to Week 14 and 24 of 43% for Remicade-treated patients vs 0% for placebo-treated patients). During the placebo-controlled portion of the trial (24 weeks), 54% of Remicade-treated patients achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in HAQ-DI (≥0.3 unit decrease) compared to 22% of placebo-treated patients. Remicade-treated patients also demonstrated greater improvement in the SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores than placebo-treated patients. The responses were maintained for up to 2 years in an open-label extension study.  Plaque Psoriasis The safety and efficacy of Remicade were assessed in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients 18 years of age and older with chronic, stable plaque psoriasis involving ≥10% BSA, a minimum PASI score of 12, and who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Patients with guttate, pustular, or erythrodermic psoriasis were excluded from these studies. No concomitant anti-psoriatic therapies were allowed during the study, with the exception of low-potency topical corticosteroids on the face and groin after Week 10 of study initiation. Study I (EXPRESS) evaluated 378 patients who received placebo or Remicade at a dose of 5 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 (induction therapy), followed by maintenance therapy every 8 weeks. At Week 24, the placebo group crossed over to Remicade induction therapy (5 mg/kg), followed by maintenance therapy every 8 weeks. Patients originally randomized to Remicade continued to receive Remicade 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through Week 46. Across all treatment groups, the median baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score ranged from moderate (52% of patients) to marked (36%) to severe (2%). In addition, 75% of patients had a BSA >20%. Seventy-one percent of patients previously received systemic therapy, and 82% received phototherapy. Study II (EXPRESS II) evaluated 835 patients who received placebo or Remicade at doses of 3 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 (induction therapy). At Week 14, within each Remicade dose group, patients were randomized to either scheduled (every 8 weeks) or as needed (PRN) maintenance treatment through Week 46. At Week 16, the placebo group crossed over to Remicade induction therapy (5 mg/kg), followed by maintenance therapy every 8 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the median baseline PASI score was 18, and 63% of patients had a BSA >20%. Fifty-five percent of patients previously received systemic therapy, and 64% received a phototherapy. Study III (SPIRIT) evaluated 249 patients who had previously received either psoralen plus ultraviolet A treatment (PUVA) or other systemic therapy for their psoriasis. These patients were randomized to receive either placebo or Remicade at doses of 3 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. At Week 26, patients with a sPGA score of moderate or worse (greater than or equal to 3 on a scale of 0 to 5) received an additional dose of the randomized treatment. Across all treatment groups, the median baseline PASI score was 19, and the baseline sPGA score ranged from moderate (62% of patients) to marked (22%) to severe (3%). In addition, 75% of patients had a BSA >20%. Of the enrolled patients, 114 (46%) received the Week 26 additional dose. In Studies I, II and III, the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in score of at least 75% from baseline at Week 10 by the PASI (PASI 75). In Study I and Study III, another evaluated outcome included the proportion of patients who achieved a score of ""cleared"" or ""minimal"" by the sPGA. The sPGA is a 6-category scale ranging from ""5 = severe"" to ""0 = cleared"" indicating the physician's overall assessment of the psoriasis severity focusing on induration, erythema, and scaling. Treatment success, defined as ""cleared"" or ""minimal,"" consisted of none or minimal elevation in plaque, up to faint red coloration in erythema, and none or minimal fine scale over <5% of the plaque. Study II also evaluated the proportion of patients who achieved a score of ""clear"" or ""excellent"" by the relative Physician's Global Assessment (rPGA). The rPGA is a 6-category scale ranging from ""6 = worse"" to ""1 = clear"" that was assessed relative to baseline. Overall lesions were graded with consideration to the percent of body involvement as well as overall induration, scaling, and erythema. Treatment success, defined as ""clear"" or ""excellent,"" consisted of some residual pinkness or pigmentation to marked improvement (nearly normal skin texture; some erythema may be present). The results of these studies are presented in Table 12.

In Study II, in the subgroup of patients with more extensive psoriasis who had previously received phototherapy, 72% and 77% of patients on 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg Remicade achieved a PASI 75 at Week 10 respectively compared with 1% on placebo. In Study II, among patients with more extensive psoriasis who had failed or were intolerant to phototherapy, 70% and 78% of patients on 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg Remicade achieved a PASI 75 at Week 10 respectively, compared with 2% on placebo. Maintenance of response was studied in a subset of 292 and 297 Remicade-treated patients in the 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg groups; respectively, in Study II. Stratified by PASI response at Week 10 and investigational site, patients in the active treatment groups were re-randomized to either a scheduled or as needed maintenance (PRN) therapy, beginning on Week 14. The groups that received a maintenance dose every 8 weeks appear to have a greater percentage of patients maintaining a PASI 75 through Week 50 as compared to patients who received the as-needed or PRN doses, and the best response was maintained with the 5 mg/kg every 8-week dose. These results are shown in Figure 4. At Week 46, when Remicade serum concentrations were at trough level, in the every 8-week dose group, 54% of patients in the 5 mg/kg group compared to 36% in the 3 mg/kg group achieved PASI 75. The lower percentage of PASI 75 responders in the 3 mg/kg every 8-week dose group compared to the 5 mg/kg group was associated with a lower percentage of patients with detectable trough serum infliximab levels. This may be related in part to higher antibody rates  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In addition, in a subset of patients who had achieved a response at Week 10, maintenance of response appears to be greater in patients who received Remicade every 8 weeks at the 5 mg/kg dose. Regardless of whether the maintenance doses are PRN or every 8 weeks, there is a decline in response in a subpopulation of patients in each group over time. The results of Study I through Week 50 in the 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks maintenance dose group were similar to the results from Study II. Figure 4: Proportion of patients achieving ≥75% improvement in PASI from baseline through Week 50; patients randomized at Week 14   Efficacy and safety of Remicade treatment beyond 50 weeks have not been evaluated in patients with plaque psoriasis.

"I tried Modafinil a few years back and used it on and off for a couple of years. The 1st few times I used it, it was an absolute godsend and allowed me to carry on working. But when I then tried it a couple of years back, I had to stop it as it gave me horrible side effects. Was really gutted as it was a wonder drug for me but I guess my body had other ideas. I agree with the discussion about risk taking and the worry about all possible side effects and weighing up your options. I took 2 extremely serious relapses last year and have now been given the choice of 3 new meds I can have 'Tysabri', 'Gilenya' or 'Lemtrada'. They all come with their own risks but after being so ill and experiencing the worst relapses Ive ever had - I got a glimpse of what the future could hold and it wasnt nice. So I have to now choose a very serious drug, with potentially very serious side effects, to prevent a very serious illness from getting seriously worse..go figure lol!!",gilenya
"So I started on Cladribine injections this week. Popped into the hospital Monday. Had to sign a sheet which was making sure I had been told various things and given an information sheet. Then injection into stomach just right of the belly button. Was due to take the triple test (think that's what they called it) but the person I needed to see was busy. Was also asked to give a urine sample which normally would not be a problem but typically I couldn't so took the pot away to be brought back the following day. Was given 60 days of an antiviral drug to take one tablet each evening. Tuesday went along again and had the second injection just to the left of the belly button this time. Took the test, 9-peg, how well do you manage with every day tasks and a timed 25ft walk. Went on Wednesday for the third injection. Back on the right side this time. Had a slight bruise from the Monday jab, I do bruise easily, but other than that nothing else to report at present. Back to the hospital the week of 19 March for a blood test and then 2nd round of injections starting on 26 March. Once the 2nd round of injections are done I have to go for a blood test every three months. I had a letter from the hospital around the start of all of this with the schedule of blood test weeks, year 2 injections etc and the final blood test for this treatment is in April 2020 so only a little way off.",cladribine

"Thanks for your help, Jim. The title is perfect. I forgot to mention that even with the months-long wait without treatment, my most recent CT scans showed the lung lesions pretty much stable, with slight growth in mediastinal lymphs and growth from 5 cm to 7 cm in my liver. It seems a little odd to me that the tumors wouldn’t all grow at about the same rate, but I guess that cancer knows no rules. I suspect that the relatively slow growth overall is due to residual effects from the nivolumab. I’m just so glad to have whatever it is that is keeping these things from running rampant!

"FEBRUARY 19, 2016 There is finally some progress in the hunt for a treatment for the most difficult form of multiple sclerosis — the form that has stubbornly resisted every attempt to find a therapy. The catch, experts say, is that people with this form of the disease should keep their expectations low, because even the new drug that’s now in the last stages of development doesn’t appear to have a big clinical impact. The reason that the new drug is generating so much interest, though, is that it’s the first time a therapy for primary progressive MS has had any impact at all. And it’s the first MS drug to ever receive a “breakthrough” designation from the Food and Drug Administration, which puts the experimental medicine on a fast track to get through the review process as quickly as possible. The agency granted the designation earlier this week. Read more: Father, daughter fight different forms of MS Primary progressive MS is a relatively rare form of the neurological disease in which a person doesn’t have severe attacks, the way people do with the more common, relapsing-remitting kind. Instead, they suffer a slow, steady physical deterioration with no hope of recovery. The FDA has approved 13 drugs for treating relapsing-remitting MS, but none have been shown to work for people with primary progressive disease. The new “breakthrough” drug, called ocrelizumab, is one of six that are in various stages of development for this recalcitrant form, one that affects 10 to 15 percent of the estimated 400,000 Americans living with MS. On Friday, the company behind ocrelizumab, the Roche subsidiary Genentech, will release new Phase 3 trial data at a conference of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, which is being held in New Orleans. Genentech has already published a first round of the results, which showed some impact on a wide range of measures for people with primary progressive MS. The new data will include more detail on how ocrelizumab affected subgroups of patients, as well as new information on how it worked in people with relapsing-remitting MS, to show whether it can also work on the more common variety of the disease.

"That seems to be it exactly Linda, if the rituxan doesn't seem to be working it might be worth a try to switch to ocrevus. On the improvement front, I've noticed some minor ones too. I am walking better, sometimes without a cane, although I always carry one with me on longer walks because when things fall apart, it's not pretty. I know there is some permanent damage but if the rituxan keeps the MS at bay, I'm hopeful that I might continue to see improvements. Personally I think that's a pretty big deal at my age!",ocrevus

"Brain volume loss in multiple sclerosis (MS) is primarily driven by grey matter changes and may be independent of clinically effective treatment, a new study reports. Brain volume loss is an important surrogate marker for assessing disability in MS. However, researchers felt contribution of grey and white matter to the whole brain volume loss needed further examination in the context of specific MS treatment. A team set out to examine whole and segmented grey, white, thalamic and corpus callosum volume loss in stable patients receiving natalizumab, otherwise known as Tysabri, for two to five years. The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE. Twenty patients underwent treatment with natalizumab for 24-68 months. Over a mean of 36.6 months, median percent brain volume change was 2%. There was a decline in grey, but not white matter, and thalamic but not corpus callosum volume. Grey matter loss correlated with brain volume change, but not white matter. Age significantly influenced whole brain volume loss, but disease duration and baseline T2 lesion volume did not. There was also no change in T1 relaxation values of lesions or T2 lesion volume over time. All patients remained clinically stable. Researchers concluded that these results ‘demonstrate that brain volume loss in MS is primarily driven by grey matter changes and may be independent of clinically effective treatment.’",tysabri

But during that one month waiting period also, I could manage reading, writing, driving and my work without difficulty. It was just a little discomfort.

"Lessie, The package insert for alectinib states to take it “with food” in general though a “high fat” meal was shown to increase the exposure of alectinib and it’s active metabolite (that the drug breaks down into) by about 3-fold. So eating a fatty meal prior to alectinib could result in about 3 times higher exposure. This can be variable based on the fat content in each meals and usually dosing is based on just “with food” or “empty stomach” since maintaining specific fat contents for each meal for consistency can be difficult. Basically, the bottom line is that fatty meals do increase the exposure of alectinib but could also result in higher side effects as well and I would not specifically recommend taking it with a fatty meal unless told so by your doctor. This would need to be considered if dose reductions are needed. The majority of efficacy studies were based on taking with food, not specifically high fat meals so by taking with food in general, you should still be receiving active amounts of the drug and were taking it appropriately.

"You should get checked for campylobacter and everything possible in your stool as well. I am going through the exact same thing right now, just spent a week in the hospital and still doing really bad. I have never tested positive for anything before and was shocked, at first they just checked cdiff which was negative, but then tested again for cdiff and other stuff. Campylobacter came back positive, which we never would have known if they didn't test again. High doses of prednisone and solumedrol did nothing to stop it. I have lost 15 pounds, now weigh 95 pounds. Bloody BMs 10+ times a day. Horrible cramping. They did a scope and found minimal inflammation, now I'm on antibiotics and they are not even working!

"Hi shopping14, Welcome to Grace.  I’m so sorry you’ve progressed already on tarceva.  I think you have several decent options.  A Chemo doublet with or without avastin added remains the standard of care in a scenario you’ve described. Often alimta (with and without avastin) as maintenance (directly after doublet) or at the time of progression after doublet continues to work for months or in some cases years.  It also has an excellent side effect profile, some people even describe no side effects.      Afatinib on the other hand seems to have a bit more difficult side effect profile and without much chance of efficacy after progression on tarceva.  Adding cetuximab has shown to have some efficacy though with the possibility of more side effects with its addition may make this combo less attractive. The following link is to a patient group that participated in a trial with this combo.  http://cancergrace.org/search-results?q=Afatinib%20%2BCetuximab Dr. West wrote this blog post on the subject of combining keytruda and chemo.  It speaks specifically about those with PD-L1 expression over 50% so his thoughts about it not being ready for “prime time” would apply to those without PD-L1 expression.  http://cancergrace.org/lung/2017/01/12/imprecision-medicine-why-keytruda-pembrolizumab-chemo-for-pd-l1-nsclc-isnt-ready-for-prime-time/ Trials remain a good choice if your onc thinks there’s a good possibility to help but there’s no way to know its efficacy profile.   We can’t say what you should do but we want you to have the info you need to make the decision that’s right for you.  Let us know if you have further questions.

"For over five decades, the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation has been leading the charge to find cures for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and to improve the quality of life for patients. We’ve made incredible strides through our research initiatives, including: Funding research discovering the importance of TNF-alpha and its role in IBD. Antibodies to this immune system chemical led to a number of groundbreaking biologic therapies, including infliximab (Remicade) and adalimumab (Humira). Supporting research discovering NOD2, the first gene identified as relevant for Crohn’s disease, and launching the Genetics Initiative, which has helped identify 215 genes susceptible to developing IBD. Establishing the Microbiome Initiative to study how intestinal microbiota contribute to the onset and progression of IBD. This research is helping lead the way to precision medicine for IBD. Creating IBD Qorus to develop a quality of care standard for IBD treatment across the United States to improve patient quality of life. Developing IBD Plexus, the largest IBD research database uniting clinicians, scientists, educators, industry partners, and patients to accelerate progress in research. Launching the Pediatric RISK Stratification Study, a study of the largest group of pediatric patients in the history of Crohn’s disease from the time of diagnosis. The study has identified biomarkers that can predict disease course and severity in kids with Crohn’s at the time of diagnosis. But have you ever wondered how the Foundation prioritizes what research to work on? It all began in 1990 when the Foundation convened a meeting of leading IBD researchers to update the Foundation’s research agenda and identify new priorities in IBD research. Through this meeting, research priorities and resources necessary to reach these goals were identified. The meeting produced a manuscript known as Challenges in IBD Research , which became the research roadmap for not only the Foundation but for the IBD community at large, defining a path for moving research from the bench to the bedside. Nineteen years later, Challenges in IBD Research is still guiding our research agenda. Every five years, we hold strategic meetings with scientists from academia, industry, leaders from other research foundations and members of the Foundation's National Scientific Advisory Committee (NSAC), and patients and caregivers to produce an updated Challenges in IBD Research . The final version of the document guides the Foundation’s funding and research strategies and provides guidelines for researchers planning to apply for Foundation funding. In addition, it informs research reviewers and patient communities about the Foundation’s priorities in IBD research and in addressing unmet patient needs. So where does Challenges in IBD Research stand now? Last year, we recruited and convened 100 scientists, pediatric and adult gastroenterologists, surgeons, bioengineers, industry partners, and patients and caregivers, and formed five multidisciplinary workgroups to begin to work together on the next iteration of Challenges in IBD Research . The workgroup reviewed the 2013 Challenges document to assess the progress made (spoiler alert – a lot was accomplished!), and identified five main focus areas to address unmet needs over the next five years:  Preclinical human IBD mechanisms Environmental triggers Novel technologies Precision medicine Pragmatic clinical research Our",humira

"The lung cancer treatment option plan you and your physician decide on will be based on a number of factors such as the type of lung cancer you have, where the cancer is within the lung, your overall health, the stage, results of blood tests and scans and your own wishes [32]. On your end, researching the available options and consulting with your support network, health provider and cancer team, helps immensely in choosing an appropriate treatment. Don’t be afraid to ask your doctor or specialist nurse any questions you have about your treatment. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is primarily treated with chemotherapy. Surgery is usually only an option if there is no sign that the cancer has spread to the lymph glands in the centre of the chest (the mediastinal lymph glands). This is rare with small cell lung cancer, as it has usually spread at the time of diagnosis. So chemotherapy is usually the main treatment. Radiotherapy may also be used to treat this type of lung cancer [33]. Non-small cell lung cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of these treatments, all depending on the stage when the cancer is diagnosed. Some people with advanced lung cancer may have biological therapy or immunotherapy [34]. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells which work by disrupting the growth of cancer cells. Small cell lung cancer responds well to chemotherapy drugs and is used as the primary treatment for it. Physicians often use a combination of chemotherapy drugs, including either cisplatin or carboplatin. Chemotherapy is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer after surgery for early stage cancer; before, after or alongside radiotherapy treatment; for locally advanced lung cancer or cancer that has spread [35]. Read more about chemotherapy in-depth at Cancer Research UK . Radiotherapy Radiotherapy uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells. Surgery is the most common treatment for stages I-III non-small cell lung cancer and is sometimes followed by chemotherapy. But your doctor may suggest that you have radiotherapy instead of surgery to try to get rid of the cancer cells. This is called radical radiotherapy and your doctor may suggest it if one or more of the following applies to you  You can’t have an operation due to a medical condition such as heart failure or chronic lung disease You have stage 3 cancer and the tumour is close to your heart The cancer is in an awkward place in the lung and surgery would be too difficult (an inoperable tumour) Radiotherapy is often used for cancers that grow right at the top of the lung. These tumours can be very close to the nerves that supply the arm and are difficult to operate on. They are called pancoast tumours. The radiotherapy may be followed by chemotherapy. Sometimes this makes it possible to remove the tumour with surgery afterwards. [36] Information taken from Cancer Research UK Treatment by stage for small cell lung cancer If you have early stage small cell lung cancer you are most likely to have chemotherapy and then radiotherapy to the lung. People who are in good health may have chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the same time (chemoradiation). It is quite common for this type of cancer to spread to the brain so doctors often recommend radiotherapy to the brain for people whose tumours shrink with chemotherapy treatment. You typically will have radiotherapy to the brain at the end of the chemo treatment. The radiotherapy aims to kill any remaining cancer cells that may have spread to the brain but are too small to show up on scans. Doctors call this prophylactic cranial irradiation or PCI. For very early stage small cell lung cancer that has not spread to the lymph nodes in the centre of the chest (the mediastinal lymph nodes), you may have surgery to remove the part of the lung containing the tumour (a lobectomy). The surgery is followed by chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy. But usually the cancer has already spread at the time of diagnosis and surgery is not then possible. If you have small cell cancer that has spread to lymph nodes or other areas of the body you may have chemotherapy, radiotherapy or treatment to relieve symptoms. If the chemotherapy shrinks the lung tumour down and you are fairly fit you may also receive radiotherapy to the brain to kill any cancer cells that may have already spread there. [37] Information taken from Cancer Research UK Treatment by stage for non-small cell lung cancer Stage 1 Stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer is uncommon. You normally have surgery to remove part of the lung or the entire lung. If pre-existing health reasons don’t allow for the operation, your doctor may suggest targeted radiotherapy instead. Another option for small tumours if you cannot have surgery is radio frequency ablation (RFA). Stage 2 For stage 2 non-small cell lung cancer, you may be offered surgery. Depending on the position of the tumour, your surgeon may remove part of the lung or the entire lung. If the cancer is removed, your specialist may suggest chemotherapy. This lowers the risk of the cancer coming back. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. If the surgeon cannot remove all of the tumour you may have radiotherapy afterwards. If you can’t have surgery due to other health concerns, your doctor may offer radiotherapy or combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy (chemoradiation). This treatment aims to try to get rid of the cancer completely. Stage 3 For stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer you may be able to have surgery, depending on where the cancer is located in the lung or you may need to have the whole lung removed). If the surgeon succeeds in removing the cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy will be used to lower the risk of the cancer coming back. However, if the surgeon finds cancer cells in the lymph nodes during the surgery they are likely to advise you to have chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy after the operation. If you can’t have surgery due to other health concerns, your doctor may offer radiotherapy or combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy (chemoradiation). This treatment aims to try to get rid of the cancer completely. If your scans showed that there are cancer cells in the middle area of the chest (the mediastinum), your doctor may suggest radiotherapy instead of surgery. If the cancer is too close to your heart, a surgeon cannot operate safely. Your doctor may advise that you have a course of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. Some people who are in good health and have small tumours have radiotherapy concurrent to chemotherapy (concomitant chemoradiotherapy). Concomitant chemoradiotherapy causes more side effects than the treatments on their own, so the patient must be well enough to cope with the increase in side effects. If scans show signs of cancer in the lymph nodes on the opposite side of your chest, surgery is not possible. Chemotherapy will be an option, potentially followed up by radiotherapy. As mentioned above, patients in good physical health may receive chemoradiation. Stage 4 Treatment for stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer tries to control the cancer and to shrink the tumour down to reduce symptoms. Many clinical trials have used chemotherapy in this situation and research has shown that it can help people to live longer as well as relieve symptoms. People whose cancer cells have particular proteins (receptors) may have treatment with biological therapy drugs called erlotinib (Tarceva), gefitinib (Iressa) or crizotinib (Xalkori). If you have had chemotherapy and it is no longer controlling the cancer, you may have further chemotherapy if you are well enough. If your cancer has EGFR receptors your doctor may offer erlotinib treatment. Or you may choose to have no further active treatment but to control your symptoms with medicines. You may have radiotherapy to control symptoms such as pain or a cough. As well as radiotherapy, other treatments can relieve a blockage and reduce symptoms if you have a tumour in one of the main airways (the left or right bronchus). These treatments include:  Internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) Laser treatment Freezing the tumour (cryotherapy) Using a rigid tube (a stent) to keep the airway open Light therapy (photodynamic therapy – PDT) To get more in-depth information on different kinds of treatment available during the different stages, please visit the Canadian Cancer Society . [38] Information taken from Cancer Research UK Discussing things with your doctor An appointment where you are given your diagnosis and told about your treatment options is very important. You are likely to be shocked and might find it hard to take in information or make decisions. When you go to see the doctor it often helps to write down a list of questions you want to ask. There may be more than 1 treatment option that is suitable for you. It’s important that you feel OK about the treatment your specialist recommends. Most people feel more comfortable about this if they understand why a particular treatment decision has been made. Doctors expect patients to want to ask questions and they appreciate that you need things explained in a way you can understand. It is important that your doctor fully explains all options to you and their benefits and possible problems. Your doctor won’t give any treatment without your permission (consent). In some situations you may feel that you don’t want to have treatment, for example if the treatment has only a small chance of helping you and may cause bad side effects. Your doctor can explain what will happen if you don’t have the treatment and they will go along with your wishes. Support during appointments You could take a close friend or relative with you to the appointment. They can help you to remember what is said. If you feel that you need more time to think things through or discuss the options, you can ask your specialist to see you again. Then you can discuss things more fully before you make a decision. There are also lung cancer specialist nurses you can talk to. They can answer questions about your cancer and its treatment. Second opinions Some people feel they would like to get an opinion from a second doctor before they decide on their treatment. Most doctors are happy to refer you to another specialist for a second opinion if you would find this helpful. You can discuss this with your GP or cancer specialist, who can make the referral for you.

"Like everyone else I am getting older, and I am being asked to talk more and more about the future (a coincidence?).

While preparing one of these talks, I thought that nobody would have been able to predict what was about to happen (the future) in the nearly 40 years that followed my graduation from medical school in 1979. Below I list a number of things that have occurred from then until now. To some extent, this is a sort of experiment where, knowing  de facto what has occurred, we ask ourselves if we would ever have been able to predict these events (  i.e. can we predict the future from the past?). I believe that this exercise illustrates well the difficulties in predicting the future, since the answer to this question is almost certainly no. The list, not meant to be exclusive or prioritised, includes several very significant advances.  Past advances Advances in general Computers Computers have changed the way we work and understand the world. Among many other things, computers have allowed the development of internet, e-mail and PubMed; older readers will, no doubt, remember the many hours spent in the library searching the endless Index Medicus, whereas now PubMed is a mouse-click away (  figure 1 )! Likewise, computers allowed the development of electronic health records; older readers will remember those thick, heavy paper clinical histories of chronic patients with several concomitant diseases! Electronic health records have many positive aspects no doubt [  1 ]; however, a word of caution is needed if we intend to use them for research (so called “Big Data”) since many of them may not have the quality required for research purposes [  2 ].    Download figure Open in new tab Download powerpoint FIGURE 1 Evolution of medical information from a) the Index Medicus to d) PubMed, facilitated by b) the emergence of computers, which in turn allowed c) the development of the internet.  Mobile technologies Mobile phones, tablets and the like have offered a personal, wearable connection to the internet that all young residents use to access up-to-date health-related information platforms, as well as other sources, when faced with a clinical problem. In fact, basically all of us have a personal computer in our pocket that is able to make telephone calls besides! This is facilitating tele-health and novel forms of digital research.  Imaging techniques Imaging techniques, including echography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, have undergone a sort of big bang that has changed drastically the way many patients are diagnosed and treated.  Minimally invasive procedures New procedures including coronary artery stenting, heart-valve replacement using peripheral artery access, laparoscopic and video-assisted thoracic surgery and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery have been developed and implemented in clinical practice.  New diseases New diseases such as HIV, Ebola and Zika have emerged and had a very significant impact on the population.  New aetiologies (and treatments) for old diseases New aetiologies (and treatments) for old diseases have emerged, such as the use of antibiotics to treat Helicobacter Pylori in peptic ulcer cases, which has ended a glorious time for many gastric surgeons!  Bringing Mendel's peas to the clinic Mendel's peas (  figure 2 ) used to be a sort of funny historical anecdote in my years at medical school; however, they now without doubt represent the future (even the present?) for the prediction, understanding and tailored treatment of many (if not all) human diseases [  5 ]. It is of note that these peas and the associated Mendelian traits are now much more difficult to understand, since they do not depend only on one or more specific genes but also on many functional factors that modulate their final clinical impact ( e.g. epigenetics).

Intensive care units Intensive care units (ICUs) were nonexistent when I graduated (at least in Spain). The first examples were (again) led by cardiologists (as coronary units) and, sometime later, more general ICUs began to emerge in hospitals. Monitoring and life-sustaining techniques (ventilators, aortic pumps and other devices) have been instrumental in saving many lives since.  Guidelines Guidelines for the most prevalent diseases, based as much as possible in scientific evidence generated via randomised clinical trials (so-called evidence-based medicine), have become prevalent [  6 ].  Advances in respiratory medicine Admittedly, some of the advances named above facilitated the emergence of others in a sort of concatenated chain of events. For instance, advances in computer technologies facilitated new imaging techniques, which in turn allowed invasive procedures and monitoring techniques. In addition, this is a list of general medical advances; however, if I look into my own field of medical expertise (respiratory diseases) it is apparent that many advances have also occurred in this field since I graduated in 1979 and most, if not all of them, would have been extremely difficult to predict at that time.  Metered dose inhalers Metered dose inhalers, later followed by dry powder inhalers, have dramatically changed the way patients with airway diseases are currently treated, for the most part with great success. Inhaled drugs were, initially, short-acting bronchodilators ( e.g. salbutamol and ipratropium) [  7 ,  8 ]. Soon after, inhaled steroids were also introduced and this again changed the asthma landscape dramatically for the better, albeit not completely [  9 ]. More recently, both long-acting β-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists were introduced and are now combined in single inhalers. By and large this is to the benefit of patients, although some controversies still exist [  10 ].  Pulse oximetry Pulse oximetry has allowed the emergence of a new medical field (sleep medicine) and the definition of a new disease, obstructive sleep apnoea [  11 ]. This identification was soon followed by a novel treatment, continuous positive airway pressure [  12 ], which in turn led to the development of noninvasive ventilation, which is now used successfully for the treatment of several acute conditions (such as exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure) as well as several chronic conditions (such as respiratory failure of skeletal or muscular origin). The latter can be complemented by domiciliary long-term oxygen therapy when needed.  Fibreoptic bronchoscopy Nowadays considered a standard, fibreoptic bronchoscopy was a true revolution for the respiratory community, allowing several diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.  Genetic diseases Amazing advances have occurred in the understanding of the basic molecular abnormalities and treatment of diseases such as α 1 -antitrypsin deficiency and cystic fibrosis, resulting in dramatic improvements in the life expectancy of patients [  13 –  15 ].  Interstitial lung diseases New and promising therapeutic alternatives ( e.g. pirfenidone, nintedanib) are now available [  16 ,  17 ].  Lung cancer Screening using low-dose CT has demonstrated a 20% reduction in mortality in lung cancer cases [  18 ]. In addition, recent achievements in the treatment of lung cancer, including the use of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( e.g. rociletinib) [  19 ] and the novel check-point inhibitors ( e.g. nivolumab) [  20 ], have improved the survival rate of these patients, albeit that a lot remains to be done in this area.  Pulmonary hypertension Traditionally considered only in the context of “cor pulmonale” ( i.e. pulmonary hypertension due to a respiratory disease) and/or heart failure, pulmonary hypertension is now recognised more and more as a primary ( i.e. idiopathic) disease or as a disorder associated with other systemic disorders or chronic pulmonary emboli [  21 ]. As stated above, this does not pretend to be “the list”. I apologise if anyone considers that other important events should have been included, they are likely to be right. This is only a list out of my mind (after giving some thought to it though). In any case, did all these advances occur at no cost? Of course not! All of them required a significant amount of research and investment. Have we forgotten something by having them so at hand? I believe that the answer is yes. I am particularly concerned that young doctors seem to be becoming increasingly techno-dependent and may forget (or worse, may never have been trained in) some very basic aspects of medical care, including a careful and well-integrated medical history and a detailed physical exam. Only after these first two key steps in medical practice have been undertaken should a physician integrate this information and think (always a good thing to do) about the differential diagnosis and the most cost-efficient and safe diagnostic test and/or therapeutic alternatives. Needless to say, excessive technological dependence may also jeopardise the necessary patient–physician human relationship.  Potential future advances Considering all of the above, does anyone think that the future, say over the next 40 years, can be predicted accurately? I propose here that we take advantage of modern technologies and start a conversation within the European Respiratory Society (  via the  European Respiratory Journal (  ERJ ) website?) where people can predict what will happen. I will open this conversation here. My list below includes some general medical issues but is mostly focused on our common area of expertise: respiratory health. Again, it does not pretend to be “the list” and is not prioritised. I believe that the following will occur in the next 40 years and have categorised the topics as highly likely (we are almost there) and unpredictable (but possible; if not, I should have left this space blank!). Please join me in this conversation.  Highly likely advances Precision medicine [ 22 ] Most human diseases are heterogeneous. More and more, their appropriate prevention and treatment will require a precision diagnosis ( e.g. biomarkers) and a precision treatment ( e.g. biologics) targeting specific endotypes (not symptoms at large, as we do now in many cases) [  23 ]. This implies moving from population-derived risk factors ( i.e. randomised clinical trials generating evidence-based medicine) to individual specific ones (how do we do this?).  New classifications of disease [ 24 , 25 ] The current classification of diseases is becoming out-of-date in this post-genomic era because it includes different disease states under the same diagnostic category. It does not generally consider individual susceptibility to disease and it cannot be used to individualise modern biological therapies [  24 ,  26 ]. We should be (and will be) more interested in understanding the biology underlying different diseases than in arguing about the most appropriate diagnostic label, as we often do today [  22 ,  25 ].  The microbiome We humans live in close contact with a myriad of bacteria, viruses and fungi, not only in the skin or gut (as we were traditionally taught) but also in other organs, such as the lungs. The lungs were traditionally thought to be sterile in a healthy subject simply because the traditional microbiological culture techniques were not able to facilitate the growth of all these species and were, therefore, considered negative. By contrast, the use of modern molecular techniques has rapidly destroyed this dogma; however, we do not yet know how these communities of different micro-organisms in the lungs (and elsewhere) interact with the epithelium both in health and disease, but this is likely to be extremely important. Furthermore, the gut is likely to become a new immune organ, so we will have to pay more attention to the gut microbiome in our respiratory patients.  Beyond smoking Smoking is, no doubt, a major respiratory insult but, more and more, other environmental stressors (besides infectious agents) such as air pollution and microparticles will be considered more carefully in the pathobiology of several respiratory diseases.  Early life events Today, an infant with respiratory problems ( e.g. wheezing) is very likely to be diagnosed with asthma, yet it is highly likely that due to a variety of genetic and environmental factors the lungs might not develop properly in some individuals. These developmental problems may, at first, lead to a misdiagnosis of asthma in infancy but also to chronic airway diseases in late adulthood [  27 –  30 ]. Understanding the biological basis of these disorders of lung maturation and identifying these individuals early in life will be important in order to treat them and to prevent later comorbidities.  Earlier lung cancer diagnosis By refining the population to screen and/or by combining it with circulating ( i.e. liquid biopsies), urinary and/or exhaled biomarkers earlier diagnosis will become possible (so lung cancer can be cured!) [  31 ].  Interventional pulmonology Pulmonologists will follow the lead of the cardiologists and will become more interventional, although I admit that this is probably more a wish than a prediction!  Space travel Space travel will require respiratory support and new research.  Social debate on the ethics and sustainability of prolonging life Is there any limit? Can we sustain any goal? In relation to this, it is likely that healthcare systems will undergo profound organisational changes and that several roles will change (specialised nurses, technologists, etc .).  Smaller (atomic) or integrative (network) medicine For the past 400 years, medical research has chosen to go smaller (from the whole body, to organs, to cells, to molecules). What is to be the next step, going even smaller (atomic medicine)? I believe that the next step is to be more integrative. Biology is about networks of genes, proteins, lipids, cells, organs and environmental factors, as illustrated in  figure 3 [  32 ]. When we were going smaller we used to focus on a progressively smaller number of cells or molecules and, by doing so, we lost track of the general picture (we “couldn't see the wood for the trees!”). More and more, we are trying to integrate available information ( e.g. network analysis [  33 ]) and to develop mathematical models of disease ( i.e. systems biology [  34 ]) to better understand disease pathogenesis and, by doing so, identify novel therapeutic targets that act in specific areas of the network [  35 ]. This will eventually allow the in silico design of new drugs (synthetic biology [  36 ]).

Reproduced and modified from [  32 ] with permission.  Global health Most of the predictions above refer to the so-called first (or developed) world. Yet, it represents only a minority of the world, where developing countries (or the third world) represent the vast majority. The relationship between both worlds is bidirectional and will become more so. Medicine will probably evolve in developing countries by adopting many of the advances that developed countries already enjoy. However, the third world may also influence the first via a number of mechanisms that include massive immigration and imported old ( e.g. tuberculosis) and new (viral?) diseases. Needless to say, global warming may also have significant effects on human health, both in the first and third worlds.  Unpredictable advances Prevent and cure all human disease This is the Holy Grail and the ultimate goal of medicine. To this end, many people in healthcare systems, the drug industry and other health-related companies, as well as in Government, invest a lot of time, effort, creativity and money to improve the treatment of disease. Perhaps, we should change this strategy slightly and try to prevent the occurrence of disease or, at least, diagnose them as early as possible in order to maximise the chances of a complete cure (by the use of wearable, personal biomonitoring devices?). Imagine if, one way or another, in the long-distant future we achieve this goal. If so, it is predicted that humans may live for 150–200 years on average. Would that society be sustainable? If, as most of you might be thinking, the answer is no, why do we keep pursuing this goal? Perhaps some social debate is needed here.  Organ regeneration The field of stem cell research is extremely active today; however, to date, it has not really delivered clinically applicable therapeutics. I hope that it will do so in the future.  Artificial (bioengineered) organs As for organ regeneration, the development of bioengineered organs is conceivable; however, it is not clear when this will be a reality, if it eventually is.  Cell and gene therapy Both cell and gene therapy have already been around for some time but without too much success so far.  Use of nanoparticles for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes This is a very active research field; however, real practical applications are, to my knowledge, still outside daily practice. The potential of this area is huge, particularly if combined with new noninvasive imaging techniques.  Summary This is my wish list which, almost certainly, time will prove wrong. Please help me to improve it by participating in the  ERJ conversation, which will be open for 3 months. After that time, I will analyse the information and get back to you. If successful (this is up to you, but thanks for participating anyway), such information will be extremely helpful, at least for my next talk on the future!",nivolumab

We’ve had the disappointing news that MS drug ocrelizumab won’t be made available for primary progressive MS.,ocrelizumab
"Twenty years ago, the idea that B-cell depletion could treat multiple sclerosis would have been greeted with a hearty laugh by any well-respected neurologist or MS researcher — or perhaps a scoff. But times change and research advances. Today, a medicine that gets rid of certain B-cells may be the most powerful drug yet developed against MS — even benefitting primary progressive patients who, until now, had no approved therapies for their condition. With the approval of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) now in hand, Multiple Sclerosis News Today looks at how this game changer of an MS drug came into being.  The early days “The journey of ocrelizumab in MS started about 15 years ago,” Dr. Peter Chin, a neurologist and the principal medical director of Global Neuroscience Development at Genentech, said when Multiple Sclerosis News Today spoke to him in February. For academic researchers, the work started even earlier. On a backdrop of skepticism, some began thinking outside the box . They had noted that autoantibodies seemed to be involved in MS disease processes, but only in conjunction with disease-causing T-cells. But since the antibodies, seen in both human patients and animal models, were of so many different sorts, the researchers turned their sights to B-cells. A proportion of B-cells become antibody-producing plasma cells; by targeting these cells, the scientists reasoned, maybe it would be possible to get to the autoantibodies. At that point, Genentech began to work with the academic researchers to launch a small clinical trial in patients. The first small proof-of-concept studies yielded surprising results: It was apparent that B-cells carrying the CD20 molecule on their surface played a more prominent role in disease mechanisms than anyone had previously thought. While the research community at large remained highly skeptical about treating MS with B-cell depleting drugs, the science began speaking for itself. The first clinical trial showed that a single administration of a B-cell depleting drug reduced the presence of inflammatory brain lesions by 91 percent , and significantly reduced relapses, measured six months after treatment. First tested for MS was a different Genentech B-cell depleting compound — Rituxan ( rituximab ). It had been developed for B-cell cancers, and was gaining ground as a treatment for autoimmune conditions. While study results showed that B-cells were, indeed, involved in MS, they largely excluded the possibility that antibodies were driving disease. The treatment effect was noted almost immediately, making it highly unlikely that the benefits were linked to reduced levels of antibodies, which take longer to control. Genentech had initially judged the success rate for B-cell depletion in MS as “lower than 15 percent,” but quickly realized that a B-cell strategy could be more effective than any other approach taken so far. “At that time, we had a number of B-cell targeted anti-CD20 molecules in our portfolio with different properties,” Chin said in the interview . “We advanced ocrelizumab , a humanized anti-CD20 antibody, into late-stage development because we believed it had the best potential for efficacy and safety in people with MS, a disease where long-term treatment is warranted.” Ocrelizumab had failed in previous clinical trials involving patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (both autoimmune conditions), but its path in MS would take another route.  Well-founded optimism The first report of Ocrevus ’ efficacy came in 2010, when an early analysis of a Phase 2 trial ( NCT00676715 ) confirmed what researchers had seen with Rituxan. The study’s lead investigator called the results “among the most remarkable seen in a phase II RRMS study.” A year later, Genentech reported that two-thirds of patients were free of disease activity in the form of brain lesions, relapses, or disability progression after being treated for nearly two years. In addition to these preliminary, but very promising, effects, analyses showed that the treatment triggered only very low levels of anti-drug antibodies . Biological drugs, such as Ocrevus, always run the risk of becoming ineffective because of a neutralizing immune response, in which the body produces antibodies that prevent the drug from working. These encouraging findings spurred Genentech to advance development. Not only did the company launch two Phase 3 trials — the OPERA I and OPERA II studies ( NCT01247324 and NCT01412333 ) — in relapsing MS, it also started recruiting primary progressive patients into a third Phase 3 trial, named ORATORIO ( NCT01194570 ). The two relapsing MS studies compared Ocrevus with high doses of the standard-of-care drug Rebif (interferon beta-1a). Primary progressive patients were treated with either Ocrevus or placebo.  Finally, success As researchers and patients kept working on the Phase 3 studies, several quiet years followed with few updates on the drug’s progress. Then, in 2015, Genentech released first results from the OPERA I and II trials. Both studies had met primary and key secondary endpoints: Ocrevus reduced relapse rates, slowed the progression of disability, and minimized the number of brain lesions compared to Rebif-treated patients. “Ocrelizumab showed remarkable improvements over a standard-of-care medicine across clinical and imaging endpoints in two pivotal studies,” said Sandra Horning, MD, chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development, at the time. Later that year, Genentech caught the attention of primary progressive MS patients worldwide. A group that had grown accustomed to failed trials now learned that the ORATORIO trial was successful. “This is an important moment for the MS community,” Xavier Montalban, MD, PhD, chair of the Scientific Steering Committee for the ORATORIO study and a professor of neurology and neuroimmunology at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital and Research Institute in Spain, said in a 2015 press release . “For decades, trial after trial has failed to show the benefit of any medicine for people with primary progressive MS. Now, for the first time, we have a positive Phase 3 study result for people with this debilitating form of the disease.” For the first time in history, Genentech applied for FDA approval of Ocrevus to treat both relapsing and primary progressive MS. Today, its hard work has been rewarded. “This pioneering science redefines our understanding of the underlying biology of MS and shows that B-cells, a type of immune system cell, play a central role in the disease,” Chin said. In early 2016, the FDA acknowledged the impact Ocrevus had on primary progressive MS by designating it a Breakthrough Therapy . Later that year, the agency also granted Priority Review to Ocrevus’ Biologics License Application (BLA).  Final data Genentech published data from the three Phase 3 trials — data that led to Ocrevus’ approval. The two December 2016 publications in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed what the company had shared in various conference presentations. In relapsing patients, the annualized relapse rates were 46% and 47% lower among the Ocrevus-group patients than among those treated with Rebif. Ocrevus-treated patients had 94% to 95% fewer new inflammatory brain lesions over the 96-week trial. The two trials also showed that 64% and 89% more patients receiving Ocrevus had “no evidence of disease activity,” or NEDA — a measure taking into account brain lesions, disability progression, and symptom relapses. “The consistency of these pioneering data, the effect seen in these clinical studies and the favorable safety profile may support treating MS earlier with a high-efficacy disease-modifying medicine,” Stephen Hauser, MD, chair of the Scientific Steering Committee of the OPERA studies, director of the Weill Institute for Neurosciences , and chair of the Department of Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco , said in a press release at the time. Hauser was among the researchers who first started exploring B-cell mechanisms in MS. In primary progressive patients, Ocrevus lowered the risk of six-month disability progression by 25% over the 120-week trial compared to placebo. As in relapsing patients, the treatment also lowered the number of brain lesions, which were fewer at the trial’s end than at its start. Placebo-treated patients, however, continued with a steady increase in brain lesions throughout the study. Genentech continued analyzing trial data after publication. At a recent ACTRIMS 2017 Forum , it revealed that NEDA rates in relapsing patients actually increased as treatment with Ocrevus lengthened, while no such increase was seen among Rebif-treated patients. It also presented an analysis showing “no evidence of progression” (NEP) in patients with progressive disease. Ocrevus increased NEP by 47% compared to placebo, with a total of 42.7% of patients achieving NEP over the course of the trial. The drug’s safety profile is surprisingly benign, given its effectiveness. The three trials found a similar extent of adverse events and infections, as well as serious adverse events and serious infections, in both Ocrevus-treated and control groups. Its efficacy, along with this good safety profile, has people suggesting that Ocrevus should, in fact, be considered as a first-line treatment in MS, much as Hauser earlier hinted might be the case. This optimism is, however, tempered by concerns of increased cancer risks. In all three trials, cancer rates were twice as high among those who received Ocrevus than among respective control group patients. “Rates of malignancy with ocrelizumab treatment remain within epidemiological reports and no clear relationship between B-cell suppression and malignancy has been established,” said Chin, who also reassured patients that Genentech is working to understand why the rates were numerically higher. “Patient safety is very important to us and we are committed to closely and continuously monitoring all safety data, including malignancy rates, in ongoing and future clinical studies.” Orevus’ approval will also allow for the gathering of safety data beyond a clinical trial setting. “The B-cell saga in MS has provided a cornucopia of surprises, thrilling insights, several disappointments, numerous still-to-be-solved conundrums, and also a few generic lessons,” Hauser wrote in a lecture on the topic in 2015, voicing perhaps what is now obvious: The last word has yet to be said when it comes to B-cell depletion in MS. Or, indeed, when it comes to Ocrevus itself.   :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: MS Views and News is MAKING an IMPACT for those, affected by Multiple Sclerosis MS Views and News provides Multiple Sclerosis education, information, resources and services that will benefit many affected by MS.",ocrevus

"Brand Name(s): , Tecentriq ®  WHY is this medicine prescribed? Atezolizumab injection is used to treat certain types of urothelial cancer (cancer of the lining of the bladder and other parts of the urinary tract) that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery for people unable to receive platinum-containing chemotherapy (carboplatin, cisplatin) or that has worsened during or after treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy medication. It is also used to treat a certain type of lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer: NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body and that has worsened during or after treatment with other chemotherapy medications. Atezolizumab injection is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by blocking the action of a certain protein in cancer cells. This helps the person's immune system to fight against the cancer cells, and helps to slow tumor growth.  Are there OTHER USES for this medicine? This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.  HOW should this medicine be used? Atezolizumab injection comes as liquid to be injected into a vein over 3060 minutes by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or medical facility. It is usually injected once every 3 weeks. The length of your treatment depends on how well your body responds to the medication and the side effects that you experience. Atezolizumab injection may cause serious reactions during the infusion of the medication. A doctor or nurse will monitor you carefully while you are receiving the medication. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately: flushing, fever, chills, shaking, dizziness, feeling faint, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, itching, rash, back or neck pain, or swelling of the face. Your doctor may need to slow down your infusion, delay or stop your treatment, or treat you with other medications if you experience certain side effects. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with atezolizumab. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with atezolizumab injection and each time you receive the medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( [WEB] ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.  What SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS should I follow? Before taking atezolizumab injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to atezolizumab, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in atezolizumab injection.

"Last week we discussed inject-able medications. This week let’s discuss the oral medication options that are available. Oral medications didn’t hit the market until just recently. Before then, people with MS were stuck with injection only options, which was clearly not ideal. As patients, we would hear about oral medications being an option someday in the future, but we didn’t know when it would actually happen. Until it eventually did in 2010 when Gilenya was approved by the FDA. Currently there are only three oral medications on the market approved for relapsing remitting MS. Let’s take a closer look at each of these medications.  Gilenya Gilenya is in a new class of medication called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator (that’s a mouthful). Scientist think that it works by keeping certain white blood cells in the lymph nodes, thereby making it impossible for them to cross the blood brain barrier and get into the central nervous system. Making it so the cells cannot get into the central nervous system, reduces inflammation and damage to nerve cells. In several studies done, Gilenya was shown to be effective. Gilenya cut relapses by 52% when compared to Avonex in a one year study. It also prevented relapses by 54% when compared to placebo over a two year period. The FDA approved the use of Gilenya in 2010 for relapsing remitting MS. There are several side effects associated with Gilenya. Headache, slowed heart beat, weakness, fatigue, infection, elevated liver enzyme’s and diarrhea were noted. An uncommon side effect is macular edema, which is the swelling of an area of the retina which is responsible for central vision. Gilenya is also known to slow the heart rate significantly, especially in the first month of treatment. An individual also might feel really tired, have heart palpitations or chest pain or feel dizzy. Usually if someone experiences the symptoms, they will disappear within the first day or two of treatment. In 2012 the FDA updated the regulations around a patient’s first dose of Gilenya. It is now required that an individual have an ECG before receiving the first dose and again six hours after the first dose. Is also recommended that the first dose be taken under medical observation. This is due to a patient unfortunately passing away in late 2011 after taking their first dose of Gilenya. As far as I know, the has not been definitively linked to Gilenya.  Tecfidera Tecfidera, also known as dimethyl fumarate, is an oral medication taken twice a day that was specifically developed for people with relapsing remitting MS. A similar chemical compound called Fumaderm, has been used in Germany for many years to treat flares of psoriasis. The specific way Tecfidera works is still unknown, but scientist think that it activates certain pathways in the body that help to protect nerve cells from damage and inflammation. In one study, in a two year period 27% of people who are taking Tecfidera experience a relapse compared to 46% of people in the placebo group. Tecfidera was approved by the FDA in 2014 for the use in relapsing remitting MS. Common side effects of Tecfidera include flushing, stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea. Side effects seem to be present more so at the beginning of treatment, and then will dissipate as treatment progresses. There have been cases of PML reported in patients who are taking Tecfidera, 4 of them actually. PML is a rare and deadly brain disease that can happen when individual is taking an immuno-suppressant medication. In order to develop PML, individual must be positive for the JC virus first. Routine blood test to monitor JC virus status is recommended when taking most MS meds.  Aubagio Aubagio, also known as teriflunomide, is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor. It works by reducing the number of white blood cells in the central nervous system, decreasing inflammation overall and protecting nerves in people with MS. In several studies, Aubagio was proven to be effective over placebo, reducing relapses by 31%, reducing disability progression by 30% and showing an 80% decrease in brain lesions. Aubagio was approved in 2012 by the FDA for use in relapsing remitting MS. Common side effects of Aubagio include headache, nausea, hair loss, diarrhea, elevated liver tests, like symptoms and numbness or tingling in in the hands or feet. Less common but more serious side effects include elevated blood pressure, increased risk for infections and liver damage. While taking Aubagio you will need to have regular blood test to monitor liver function and blood cell counts. Aubagio is also associated with severe birth defects, and neither women nor man should be taking Aubagio if pregnancy as planned. Aubagio can remain in your body for up to two years after discontinuing the medication, so a special treatment may be needed to remove the drug from your system if you’re planning on becoming pregnant. Usually when taking the medication, it is required that an individual be on an effective birth control method. I took Aubagio for about a year. Unfortunately I went into the treatment already in a “active disease state “, and had two relapses while taking the medication. I liked how I could just take a pill instead of the daily injections of my previous Copaxone, but I soon experienced side effects of (a lot of) hair loss and irregular blood cell counts. Due to the relapses, I eventually changed medications. The arrival of oral medications has been a welcome relief for many MS patients. They represent the constant advancement of research and development. Hopefully the future will bring many more options to the table.",gilenya
"1eye wrote: But no doctor should refuse treatment to an informed person. So why bother having doctors? Why not just just put narcotics and antibiotics on the shelves and assume everything will work out?  I am no more cynical than the people portrayed in the film ""Dallas Buyers Club"". The original dose of AZT was too toxic. Understanding of this came from randomized clinical trials, leading to safer lower dosing. Also, the FDA created an escalated orphan drug program in response to this. Clinical trials are good. Over-prescribing medication to appease desperate patients is bad. There are obviously cases in which seeking evidence delays widespread use of new treatments, but this is a necessary evil. Otherwise, we'll have widespread prescription of ineffective drugs (i.e. fingolimod in SPMS)  Don't threaten me with PML, leukemia, etc. I will take my own risks. Do you feel this way about all drugs in all situations? The patient should just decide and the doctor should just do whatever the patient says (i.e. prescribe ineffective drugs, perform unnecessary procedures)?  There is good evidence for copaxone's synergy with mitoxantrone source?  Doctors/neuros are free to do what they want to do. Nobody is forcing them to prescribe. They will anyway, regardless of what anyone tells them not to. I just think some of them are myopic and reactionary when it suits their mood, regardless of patient benefit. I agree that doctors often have imperfect judgment and commonly make errors. Why don't you go to medical school and become a perfect doctor who always prescribes the correct treatment and cures every patient.",fingolimod
"Hi, My dad was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC with bone metastasis about Sept 2013. He started taking Irressa in Nov 2013. In Feb 2015, he progressed on Iressa and entered the AZD9291 trial. Currently, the 2nd EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 is working well and he is stable. It’s been close to two year since he started taking AZD9291, which is amazing but also worring for me. Eventually, he will progress on AZD9291 and we will have to explore options. I understand most of the immunotherpy drugs are not effective for EGFR mutation patients. Also, there are single agents like Keytruda and combination of agents. Just wondering what are the options currently available right now.  Many thanks! Fischer",keytruda
"Hi all, Made my yoga goal (7 days) but fell short on 7k avg steps goal (6,760 avg). My wife has had a cold on and off for over 2 weeks and I’m fighting it off, so not as much weekend walking. I just had an Ocrevus infusion last weekend so now I’m playing it safe (being paranoid?) to avoid her cold setting in with me. Until I’m clear of any threat of illness, my only exercise goal will be daily yoga. I’ll still get steps in but not sure what average I can aim for...so no steps goal this week. Hope you all have a great week.",ocrevus
"I don't think a cure will be found sadly, but everyone saying meds haven't changed in 25 years, wasn't Remicade approved for UC no longer than 10 years ago or so? That has put a lot of people in remission. And as far as I understand Entyvio is also fairly new within a few years which has helped a good many people. HepC used to be where no one had anything to really help as far as I understand and then within the last 10 years they've made enough progress to where a medicine will now pretty much treat it no problems. I don't need a cure as long as there's a medication that can put me in permanent remission no problem, that's good enough for me.",entyvio

"Well, overall it looks like good news so far from our clinical trial. We just got back the first CT scan since my wife started the clinical trial 6 weeks ago (2 treatments, one every 3 weeks of an antibody drug conjugate). One liver tumor had no growth at all, the second liver tumor decreased in size by more than 50%. The main tumor in the lung also decreased significantly in size, although by how much is not clear.  The actual main tumor mass decreased by about 50%, however they saw a few small nodules close by the main tumor mass which they described as possible seeding.  I have not come across that term before, but I assume that means they think the main tumor might have broken apart a bit to create some smaller fragments, so they are not sure how much of the main mass is gone and how much is simply now made up of the smaller nodules.  In any case, the obstruction from the clinging of the lung to the tumor, causing the main coughing, has decreased substantially. In addition, the small thickening they were concerned about on the adrenal they saw before was not observed, although there is a new sclerotic lesion on the L5 vertebrae that has shown up. Otherwise no new sites observed, and all lung lesions are still confined to the Right middle lung.  No growths of any lymph nodes. So, the results of the first set looks good, and she is approved to go on with another 2 treatments. And also helping to ease our worriesâ€¦.most of the wedding invitations have now been sent out!

"HI there, Dee696 here, new to this site and only diagnosed since September this year. I’ve had the main symptoms last 5 years or so though confusing as were mild till diagnosis, then like a red flag to a bull and though no bull, I’m as angry as one. Anyway, the treatment decided is Gilenya which has yet to begin. I’m nervous about going on any chemicals and the many side effects and ideally would welcome a chance to explore a more holistic/herbal route so would appreciate hearing from members as regards both types and success rate. I’m not sure how long I may have MS and will take whatever steps possible to keep me as well for as long as possible. Please help. Thanks, Kind regards, Dee696.",gilenya
"If a lung cancer is under control with tagrisso and there’s no problematic side effects with it then staying on course should be an option.  Certainly the best care for metastatic nsclc has been to not treat each tumor as it shows up because it will be a generalized disease.  So what Dr. Weiss and many of his fellow lung cancer specialists are testing is new and has shown very real survival benefits.  Data is showing that people with a single driver mutation such as ALK or EGFR who have done well on targeted therapies and are now showing one or 2 sites of progression is different than the generalized progression where there are multiple sites of progression.  It would be unfortunate to ditch a treatment that may have more life left in it.  There may be an obvious answer so please don’t think me rude, what biopsy findings would drive what kind of treatment? These are the thoughts lung cancer specialists are having today about single progression sites, at least for those on targeted therapies.

"Escalation of therapy is the most widely used strategy for managing active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The difficulty in tailoring the choice of treatment to the needs of patients with multiple sclerosis reflects the complexity of the underlying decision matrix, which consists of factors such as treatment goals, available therapies, route of administration, family planning, safety and efficacy, in the context of individual disease severity. Thus, the choice of the right treatment for a concrete patient at a given time depends on multiple circumstances – including prior treatment history, disease activity and personal preference. From the article by Dr Lorscheider and colleagues, published in this issue of Multiple Sclerosis Journal ,  1 we learn that while both fingolimod and natalizumab are associated with substantial reduction in relapse frequency, natalizumab offers superior control of relapse activity and improved chance of recovery from previously accrued disability when compared to fingolimod, if used in patients who have experienced relapses despite being treated with platform injectable therapies (interferon β or glatiramer acetate) during the preceding 1 year. This study, which utilised the data from the Swiss Federation of Common tasks of Health Insurances, used methodology that is the gold standard for assessing treatment effectiveness in observational data sets. The authors studied 358 patients, matched closely on a propensity score that was derived from a comprehensive list of potential confounders, in order to minimise inclusion bias. They used paired analyses and pairwise censoring of follow-up to eliminate attrition bias. Lorscheider et al. have chosen robust disability endpoints, including 12 month confirmed improvement in Extended Disability Status Scale score, and have applied internal processes to ensure data quality and completeness. The source data set represents 65% of the Swiss multiple sclerosis population. Although the study did not estimate the vulnerability of its outcomes to potential unmeasured confounders (such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity), the authors assure us about the validity of their results through a number of converging sensitivity analyses, including analyses using different matching strategies and different definitions of prior disease activity. This study replicates the results of a number of other studies, which showed superior effect of natalizumab on relapse incidence and some of them also on improvement of disability in patients with previously active disease. These include studies completed in the French Observatoire Français de la Sclérose en Plaques (OFSEP) cohort,  2 a two-centre study in northern Italy,  3 a multicentre Italian study  4 and a study from the global MSBase registry.  5 In contrast, a study conducted in the population-based Danish National Multiple Sclerosis Registry did not find any differences in relapse and disability outcomes among 928 matched patients treated with fingolimod or natalizumab.  6 The differences in the results of observational studies may in some readers raise doubts about the validity of real-world evidence. In fact, validity of such evidence strongly depends on the quality of the underlying data and on the used statistical methodology. Reassuringly, the common denominator of the studies cited above as well as the study published in the issue of Multiple Sclerosis Journal is the high degree of rigour applied to study designs and analyses. Before the reader sets out on a journey to explore the differences in their statistical methodologies, we should contemplate the different contexts in which natalizumab and fingolimod had been compared. An interesting pattern emerges. The Danish study enrolled patients with variable disease and treatment histories, including patients with relatively low prior relapse frequency and limited treatment possession. On the other hand, the studies that showed superiority of natalizumab over fingolimod were all enriched for patients with previously high disease activity, and several of these studies even required recent failure of injectable platform therapies for patient inclusion. In summary, the currently available literature suggests that the magnitude of the difference observed between therapies of unequal anti-inflammatory potential is determined by the degree of previous inflammatory activity experienced by the studied patients. Therefore, the choice of natalizumab or fingolimod should, in addition to safety and convenience considerations, be guided by prior disease activity and treatment history. Treatment-naïve patients or those with previously stable disease may equally benefit from treatment with fingolimod or natalizumab. In contrast, patients with a relatively active disease and a history of suboptimal treatment response should opt for the more potent treatment option without hesitation. Such hypothesis is intuitive and reflects the approach already practised by many neurologists. However, conclusive evidence that will confirm that treatment escalation strategies should be driven by prior disease activity is still needed. continue",fingolimod
